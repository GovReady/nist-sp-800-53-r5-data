                    DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES
    With a renewed nation-wide emphasis on the use of trustworthy systems and supply chain
    security, it is essential that organizations can express their security and privacy requirements
    with clarity and specificity to engage industry and obtain the systems, components, and services
    necessary for mission/business success. Accordingly, this publication provides a comprehensive
    set of controls in the System and Services Acquisition (SA) family that address requirements for
    the development of systems, components, and system services. To that end, many of the
    controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and services.
    It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the controls in that family includes
    system, component, and service development and the developers associated with such
    development whether the development is conducted either internally or externally by industry
    partners (i.e., manufacturers, vendors, integrators) through the contracting and acquisition
    processes. The affected controls in the control catalog include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16,
    SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.
