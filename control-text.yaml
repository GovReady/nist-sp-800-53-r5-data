    a.   Develop, document, and disseminate to <1>:
    1.    <5> access control policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
    coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
    standards, and guidelines; and
    2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the
    associated access controls;
    b.   Designate an <2> to manage the development,
    documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and
    c.   Review and update the current access control:
    1.    Policy <3>; and
    2.    Procedures <4>.
    Discussion: This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the AC family
    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

  discussion: >
    Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest,

    anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized
    system

    users and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in
    other controls in the

    security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive
    additional

    scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and
    privileged

    access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information
    security

    officer, or senior agency official for privacy. External system accounts are not
    included in the

    scope of this control. Organizations address external system accounts through
    organizational

    policy.

    Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate
    with

    the senior agency official for privacy on establishing the specific conditions
    for group and role

    membership; specifying for each account, authorized users, group and role membership,
    and

    access authorizations; and creating, adjusting, or removing system accounts in
    accordance with

    organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration
    dates or other

    factors triggering the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define
    access privileges

    or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of the two.
    Examples of

    other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day,
    day-of-week,

    and point-of-origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations
    consider system-

    related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these
    factors could

    affect system availability.

    Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations
    establish

    temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there
    is a need for

    short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations

    establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need
    for rapid account

    activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
    authorization

    processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently
    used

    accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network
    resources are

    unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain
    available and

    are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling
    or deactivating

    accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer
    required;

    and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group account
    credentials

    when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do
    not retain

    access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require
    specialized

    training.

    In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and

    predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on run time
    access

    control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management such as attribute-based

    access control. While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user
    privileges

    typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements
    and

    operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management
    is the

    immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users
    terminate

    and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege
    management can

    also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as
    opposed to

    editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user
    privileges if

    they are operating out of their normal work times, their job function or assignment
    changes,

    or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege management

    includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes
    to encryption

    keys used for communications.

    Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow

    role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In
    contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges
    based on attributes.

  discussion: >
    When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not

    constrained regarding what actions they can take with information for which they
    have

    already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information

    are not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e.,
    subjects

    have the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction
    with

    mandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that
    is constrained

    in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under
    the less rigorous

    constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while AC-3(3) imposes
    constraints

    preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at
    a different

    sensitivity level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any
    subject at the

    same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once the information
    is passed

    outside of system control, additional means may be required to ensure that the
    constraints

    remain in effect. While traditional definitions of discretionary access control
    require identity-

    based access control, that limitation is not required for this particular use
    of discretionary

    access control.

  discussion: >
    Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access

    to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function)
    of the subject.

    Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations
    (i.e.,

    privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-

    defined roles. When users are assigned to the specific roles, they inherit the
    authorizations

    or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration
    for because

    privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can potentially be a
    large number of

    individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented
    as

    a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For those organizations implementing

    RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope
    of the

    subjects and objects covered by the policy.

    Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access revoked. For
    example, if a subject (i.e., user or process acting on behalf of a user) is removed from a

    the subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security
    labels may take effect immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to

    revocation is necessary.

    of the information designated for release.
  discussion: >
    Systems can only protect organizational information within the confines of

    established system boundaries. Additional controls may be needed to ensure that
    such

    information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established system

    boundaries. In situations where the system is unable to determine the adequacy
    of the

    protections provided by external entities, as a mitigating control, organizations
    determine

    procedurally whether the external systems are providing adequate controls. The
    means used

    to determine the adequacy of controls provided by external systems include conducting

    periodic assessments (inspections/tests); establishing agreements between the
    organization

    and its counterpart organizations; or some other process. The means used by external

    entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used
    by the

    organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication
    of

    the security and privacy policy to protect the information and individuals’ privacy.

    Controlled release of information requires systems to implement technical or procedural

    means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For
    example, if

    the system passes information to a system controlled by another organization,
    technical

    means are employed to validate that the security and privacy attributes associated
    with the

    exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively,
    if the system

    passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means
    can be

    employed to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to the printer.

    Restricting access to specific information is intended to provide flexibility
    regarding access control of specific information types within a system. For example, role-
    based access could be employed to allow access to only a specific type of personally
    identifiable information within a database rather than allowing access to the database in its
    entirety. Other examples include restricting access to cryptographic keys, authentication

    Enforce attribute-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control

  discussion: >
    Attribute-based access control is an access control policy that restricts system

    access to authorized users based on specified organizational attributes (e.g.,
    job function,

    identity); action attributes (e.g., read, write, delete); environmental attributes
    (e.g., time of

    day, location); and resource attributes (e.g., classification of a document).
    Organizations can

    create rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to
    perform needed

    operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined attributes
    and rules.

    When users are assigned to attributes defined in attribute-based access control
    policies or

    rules, they can be provisioned to a system with the appropriate privileges or
    dynamically

    granted access to a protected resource upon access. Attribute-based access control
    can be

    implemented as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For attribute-based

    access control implemented with mandatory access controls, the requirements in
    AC-3(3)

    define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.

    Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the

  discussion: >
    Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system
    and

    between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and
    without regard to

    subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking
    external

    traffic that claims to be from within the organization; keeping export-controlled
    information

    from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; restricting web requests
    that are not from

    the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations
    based

    on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations
    may require an

    agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring
    information

    between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security
    or privacy

    policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security
    or privacy

    policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at
    designated policy

    enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating
    specific

    architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement
    includes

    prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access
    only);

    verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security
    or privacy

    domain or connected system; employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information

    flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security
    or privacy

    attributes and security or privacy labels.

    Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement
    mechanisms

    to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations
    within systems

    and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of
    the information

    and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection
    devices

    that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system
    services, provide a

    packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
    capability based on

    message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering
    and/or inspection

    mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical
    to information

    flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain
    solution

    needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and
    stronger flow

    enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance

    guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf
    information

    technology products. This control also applies to control plane traffic (e.g.,
    routing and DNS).

    Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security and privacy

    attributes associated with information (i.e., data content and structure) and
    source and

    destination objects and respond appropriately when the enforcement mechanisms

    encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies.
    For

    example, an information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination

    object labeled Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not
    be allowed to

    flow to a destination object labeled Secret. A dataset of personally identifiable
    information

    may be tagged with restrictions against combining with other types of datasets,
    and

    therefore, would not be allowed to flow to the restricted dataset. Security and
    privacy

    attributes can also include source and destination addresses employed in traffic
    filter

    firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit security or privacy attributes can
    be used, for

    example, to control the release of certain types of information.

    Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross
    domain solution and determines if the information meets a pre-defined policy. Content
    filtering actions and results of filtering actions are recorded for individual messages to
    ensure the correct filter actions were applied. Content filter reports are used to assist in
    troubleshooting actions, for example, determining why message content was modified
    and/or why it failed the filtering process. Audit events are defined in AU-2. Audit records are
    generated in AU-12.

  discussion: >
    This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network

    connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated
    by systems are

    usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined
    time

    period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms
    for

    different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components.
    Responses

    to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and
    the application

    levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed
    consecutive

    invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret
    question in

    addition to the username and password; invoking a lockdown mode with limited user
    capabilities

    (instead of full lockout); or comparing the IP address to a list of known IP addresses
    for the user

    and then allowing additional logon attempts if the attempts are from a known IP
    address.

    Techniques to help prevent brute force attacks in lieu of an automatic system
    lockout or the

    execution of delay algorithms support the objective of availability while still
    protecting against

    such attacks. Techniques that are effective when used in combination include prompting
    the user

    to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon
    attempts is

    exceeded; allowing users to logon only from specified IP addresses; requiring
    a CAPTCHA to

    prevent automated attacks; or applying user profiles such as location, time of
    day, IP address,

    device, or MAC address. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period
    of time is

    generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational
    mission or

    not requiring identification or authentication.

    Discussion: Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication
    if

    organizations determine that identification and authentication is not required
    for the specified

    user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without
    identification or

    or authentication but

    may under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms
    to be

    bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical
    switch that

    commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or
    unmonitored

    use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication
    have

    already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification
    and

    authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are
    no user actions

    that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication
    and

    therefore, the value for the assignment can be none.

    Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known
    as

    data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities,
    both active and

    passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with
    individuals, devices,

    or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as
    objects, are typically

    associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process
    pipes, and

    communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions
    representing the

    basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect
    to safeguarding

    information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently, or in conjunction
    with

    security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active
    or passive entities

    with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes
    can be either

    explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational
    systems or

    system components.

    Attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the
    potential to send or

    receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change
    the system state.

    These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects)
    that contain or

    receive information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by
    a system is referred

    to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute
    type. Attributes,

    when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy
    policies for

    access control and information flow control, including data retention limits,
    permitted uses of

    personally identifiable information, and identification of personal information
    within data

    objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions
    or

    mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength
    of attribute

    binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding
    techniques

    play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow
    enforcement

    process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews
    required by

    organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect
    the ability of

    individuals to access organizational information.

    Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support
    missions or

    business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute.
    Release

    markings include US only, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), or NOFORN
    (not releasable

    to foreign nationals). By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values,
    organizations

    ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the
    association of

    attributes with the subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures
    within

    systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and
    privacy policies.

    Labels include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance

    requirements; access authorizations; nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e.,
    encryption and

    data expiration); personally identifiable information processing permissions;
    individual consent

    to personally identifiable information processing; and affiliation as a contractor.
    Conversely,

    marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-readable
    form. Marking

    enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security
    and privacy

    policies. Attribute types include classification level for objects and clearance
    (access

    authorization) level for subjects. An attribute value for both attribute types
    is Top Secret.

    Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf

    remote access

    include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual
    private networks

    of encrypted

    VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively
    treat such

    connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented
    in

    accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
    standards,

    VPN does

    not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels

  discussion: >
    A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it
    can

    easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical
    connection;

    possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained
    power

    source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities,
    on-board

    sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features
    for synchronizing

    local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile
    devices are

    typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission
    capability

    of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop
    systems,

    depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control
    of

    mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical
    action to protect

    and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are
    spaces for which

    organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements
    established for

    protecting information and systems.

    Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and
    capabilities,

    organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such
    devices. Usage

    restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration

    management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
    protective

    software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software,
    scanning for

    critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and
    possibly other

    resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

    Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational
    systems. For

    b.   Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems.
  discussion: >
    External systems are systems that are used by, but not a part of, organizational

    systems and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation
    of

    required security and privacy controls or the assessment of control effectiveness.
    External

    systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned
    computing

    and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or
    controlled by

    nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information
    systems that

    are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of
    the organization.

    External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within
    the same

    organization, and systems within the organization with different authorization
    boundaries.

    For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the
    trust relationships

    that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization
    may be

    such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these
    organizations may

    not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are
    pre-existing

    information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between
    organizations

    or components, or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive
    orders,

    directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include
    organizational

    personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational
    systems and

    over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior
    regarding

    system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals
    need not be

    uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between
    organizations.

    Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions
    on contractors

    than on state, local, or tribal governments.

    This control does not apply to external systems used to access public interfaces
    to organizational

    systems. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of
    external systems in

    accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions
    address

    as a minimum: the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational
    systems

    from external systems; and the highest security category of information that can
    be processed,

    stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the
    owners of the

    external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions
    on organizational

    personnel using those external systems.

    against unauthorized data mining.

    Discussion: Data mining is an analytical process that attempts to find correlations
    or patterns in

    large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery. Data storage objects
    include

    database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from
    data mining

    operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead
    to unanticipated

    revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing
    data mining

    activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations
    may be

    subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies
    that address data

    mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official
    for privacy

    and legal counsel regarding such requirements.

    Data mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and
    the frequency

    of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents
    of such

    databases; limiting types of responses provided to database queries; applying
    differential privacy

    techniques or homomorphic encryption; and notifying personnel when atypical database
    queries

    or accesses occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from
    data mining

    while such information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast, AU-13
    focuses on

    monitoring for organizational information that may have been mined or otherwise
    obtained from

    data stores and is available as open source information residing on external sites,
    for example,

    through social networking or social media websites.

    [EO 13587] requires the establishment of an insider threat program for deterring,
    detecting, and

    mitigating insider threats, including the safeguarding of sensitive information
    from exploitation,

    compromise, or other unauthorized disclosure. This control requires organizations
    to identify

    appropriate techniques to prevent and detect unnecessary or unauthorized data
    mining, which

    can be used by an insider to collect organizational information for the purpose
    of exfiltration.

  discussion: >
    Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate

    parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization information
    is

    transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so timely access control

    decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access
    control

    decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization
    information,

    supporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems,
    there are

    various access control decisions that need to be made and different entities make
    these

    decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the decisions.

    Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot
    be

    altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.

    Implement a reference monitor for <1> that is tamperproof, always invoked, and
    small enough to be subject to analysis and

    testing, the completeness of which can be assured.

    Discussion: A reference monitor is a set of design requirements on a reference
    validation

    mechanism that as key component of an operating system, enforces an access control
    policy

    over all subjects and objects. A reference validation mechanism is always invoked
    (i.e., complete

    mediation); tamperproof; and small enough to be subject to analysis and tests,
    the completeness

    of which can be assured (i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally
    within systems

    using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
    different

    types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects,
    are associated

    with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive
    entities, also known

    as objects, are associated with data structures such as records, buffers, communications
    ports,

    tables, files, and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control
    policies that

    restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which
    the subjects

    belong. The system enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established
    by the

    policy. The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents determined
    adversaries

    from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property
    prevents

    adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating the security policy.
    The smallness

    property helps to ensure the completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism
    to

    detect any weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent
    the enforcement of

    the security policy.

    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

    A well-trained workforce provides another organizational control that can be

    employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against
    malicious

    code coming into organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are
    trained to

    look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected
    email,

    receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from
    an

    unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel

    are also trained on how to respond to suspicious email or web communications.
    For this

    process to work effectively, personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes

    suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors
    in

    systems can provide organizations with early warning for the presence of malicious
    code.

    Recognition of anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement malicious

    code detection and protection tools and systems employed by organizations.

    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an

  discussion: >
    An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require

    logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of
    systems and the

    privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing
    needs. Event

    types include password changes; failed logons or failed accesses related to systems;
    security or

    privacy attribute changes; administrative privilege usage; PIV credential usage;
    data action

    changes; query parameters; or external credential usage. In determining the set
    of event types

    that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate
    for each of

    the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols
    that are

    operational and supported by the system.

    To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, this
    control also

    requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point
    in time. For

    example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every
    file access

    successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific
    circumstances due

    to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations
    desire to

    be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary
    to help

    ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the
    organization.

    Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information
    about individuals

    that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example,
    there is the

    potential for personally identifiable information in the audit trail especially
    if the logging event is

    based on patterns or time of usage.

    Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may
    be referenced in

    other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9),
    AC-16(11),

    AC-17(1), CM-3.f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-8, RA-8,
    SC-7(9), SC-

    7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types
    that are required

    by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
    and guidelines.

    Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level
    as information

    traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an
    important part of a

    monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems.
    Organizations

    consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related
    event types such

    as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that
    occur in service-

    oriented architectures.

  discussion: >
    Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability scanning,
    the

    generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, integrated analysis
    requires

    that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data
    collection

    activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security
    Information

    and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation
    from

    multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The
    use of

    standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized
    script

    adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing
    audit

    record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with
    vulnerability

    scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability
    scans of the

    system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation
    with

    performance data can uncover denial of service attacks or other types of attacks

    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an

  discussion: >
    Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those

    systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations; continuous monitoring;
    FISMA

    annual assessments; system design and development; systems security engineering;
    and the

    system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet
    information

    security and privacy requirements; identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the
    system design and

    development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions
    as part

    of authorization processes; and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures.
    Organizations

    conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and
    privacy plans.

    Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle
    as part of

    systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. For example, the
    design for the

    controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed and responses assessed, and as
    design reviews

    are conducted. If design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in
    accordance

    with the design is assessed during development, the final control testing can
    be a simple

    confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating
    the outcomes.

    Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment
    plan for the

    system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates
    roles and

    responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate
    in assessing a system,

    a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.

    Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability
    scanning and

    system monitoring to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during
    the system life

    cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as
    deemed necessary

    by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and
    whether the

    controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
    outcome

    with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals
    or

    roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments

    conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials,
    senior

    agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and
    authorizing official

    designated representatives.

    To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results
    from the

    following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations; continuous monitoring;
    systems

    engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations
    ensure that

    assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness,
    and

    obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control
    assessment

    results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also
    be supplemented

    with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations
    assess

    controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency
    for ongoing

    assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies.
    External audits,

    including audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies, are outside

  text: Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control assessments.
  discussion: >
    Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups

    conducting impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors
    are free

    from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding development, operation,

    sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination
    of

    control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual
    or conflicting

    interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; assess
    their

    own work; act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving;
    or place

    themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.

    Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or
    can be

    contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing
    officials

    determine the required level of independence based on the security categories
    of systems

    and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
    Authorizing

    officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient
    assurance

    that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions.
    Assessor

    independence determination also includes whether contracted assessment services
    have

    sufficient independence, for example, when system owners are not directly involved
    in

    contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting
    the

    assessments. During the system design and development phase, the analogy to independent

    assessors is having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.

    When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations

    require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,

    operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment

    processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed
    and

    analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy,
    integrity,

    and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than
    to support

    authorization decisions, are more likely to be useable for such decisions when
    performed by

    assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.

  discussion: >
    System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges

    between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections
    via leased

    lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers,
    database sharing or

    exchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges associated
    with

    cloud services, exchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file
    transfer protocols,

    network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization to organization
    communications.

    Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats, that may
    be introduced

    when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security
    and

    privacy requirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization
    and

    systems that are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems
    exchanging

    information as described in CA-6(1) or CA-6(2) may help to communicate and reduce
    risk.

    Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information exchange
    and the

    controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The type of agreement selected
    is based on

    factors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship
    between

    the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government
    to

    business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government
    or

    business to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by
    users of the other

    system. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official,
    organizations

    need not develop agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the
    systems (e.g.,

    how the information is being exchanged; how the information is protected) are
    described in the

    respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information
    have different

    authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can develop
    agreements, or

    they can provide the same information that would be provided in the appropriate
    agreement

    type from CA-3a in the respective security and privacy plans for the systems.
    Organizations may

    incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information
    exchanges

    established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (including service
    providers,

    contractors, system developers, and system integrators). Risk considerations include

  discussion: >
    Authorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to authorize

    operation of systems, to authorize the use of common controls for inheritance
    by organizational

    systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets,
    individuals,

    other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon
    controls.

    Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and
    for common

    controls or assume responsibility for the mission and business operations supported
    by those

    systems or common controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility
    and therefore,

    authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both
    responsible and

    accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use
    of organizational

    systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems
    and senior

    officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.

    Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence
    produced from

    implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs
    reduce

    the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive

    continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages
    (i.e., the

    security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones),
    is updated

    on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, system owners, and common
    control

    providers with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their
    systems, controls,

    and operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing
    officials can

    leverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent
    possible as the

    basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.

  discussion: >
    Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the

    system security and privacy posture to support organizational risk management
    decisions. The

    terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their
    controls and

    risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types
    of controls may

    require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring
    generate risk

    response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple
    controls that

    have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine
    the

    specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations
    to maintain

    the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments
    of operation

    with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.
    Having

    access to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports
    and dashboards

    gives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management
    decisions,

    including ongoing authorization decisions.

    Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware
    inventories,

    authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further
    enhanced when

    continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific,

    could fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated manner. At a minimum,
    the lack of

    consistency and coordination could mean that there are unacceptable security and
    privacy

    gaps in the system. At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented
    in one

    location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other
    controls (e.g.,

    encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). Or in other situations,
    failing to

    consistently monitor all implemented network protocols (e.g., a dual stack of
    IPv4 and IPv6)

    may create unintended vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by
    adversaries.

    <2>.
  discussion: >
    Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or

    individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited
    by adversaries.

    Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted
    by agents

    and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise
    in network,

    operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be
    used to validate

    vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to
    adversaries

    within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills.
    Penetration

    testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks
    and provides a

    more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies.
    Penetration

    testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older
    technologies to

    newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).

    Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration
    testing

    activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the
    hardware,

    software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and
    technical

    controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes pretest analysis
    based on full

    knowledge of the system; pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based
    on pretest

    analysis; and testing designed to determine exploitability of vulnerabilities.
    All parties agree to

    the rules of engagement before commencement of penetration testing scenarios.
    Organizations

    correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques,
    and

    procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Risk assessments
    guide the

    decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration

    testing.

    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or

  discussion: >
    Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic

    proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of system
    changes,

    including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes
    changes to

    baseline configurations and configuration items of systems; changes to operational
    procedures;

    changes to configuration settings for system components; unscheduled or unauthorized
    changes;

    and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Processes for managing configuration
    changes to

    systems include Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review
    and

    approve proposed changes. For changes impacting privacy risk, the senior agency
    official for

    privacy updates privacy impact assessments and system of records notices. For
    new systems or

    major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from the development

    organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Auditing
    of

    changes includes activities before and after changes are made to systems and the
    auditing

    activities required to implement such changes. See also SA-10.

  discussion: >
    Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware,

    software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture
    or functionality

    of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration
    settings

    can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems,
    mobile

    devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Security parameters
    are parameters

    impacting the security posture of systems, including the parameters required to
    satisfy other

    security control requirements. Security parameters include registry settings;
    account, file, or

    directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services,
    and remote

    connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings
    and subsequently

    derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become
    part of the

    configuration baseline for the system.

    Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists,
    lockdown and

    hardening guides, security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized,
    and established

    benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology
    products and

    platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms
    to meet operational

    requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations,

    including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal
    agencies,

    consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private
    sectors.

    Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization
    level,

    mission/business process level, or system level, or may be mandated at a higher
    level, including

    by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States
    Government

    Configuration Baseline [USGCB] and security technical implementation guides (STIGs),
    which

    affect the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The
    Security

    Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol
    provide an

    effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.

    Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions

    missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to

    services from a single system component but doing so increases risk over limiting
    the services

    provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component
    functionality

    to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or
    unnecessary

    software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols
    to prevent

    unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling.
    Organizations

    employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and
    end-point

    protection technologies such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems
    to identify

    and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least

    mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms depend on the ability
    of the

    system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to be detected since
    some

    types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT devices).
    Isolation can

    be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized system components in separate

  discussion: >
    Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of

    accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is
    not known,

    especially in large or complex connected systems. For software inventory, centrally
    managed

    software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the
    system on

    which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational
    systems and

    managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear
    more

    than once in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association
    for each

    software instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of
    components.

    Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6)
    can result in

    duplicate components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation

  discussion: >
    Configuration management activities occur throughout the system development life

    cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g.,
    the control of

    code and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities
    (e.g., control

    of installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration
    management

    plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being
    tailored to

    individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures
    for how

    configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.

    Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition
    stage of

    the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through
    change

    management processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how
    to maintain

    component inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments,
    and

    how to develop, release, and update key documents.

    Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development
    and

    implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a master

    configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented
    on a

    system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation
    of

    key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes
    to

    systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation
    of

    changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, for example,
    the

    hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed. As
    systems

    continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may
    be identified,

    and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration
    control.

    The processing of such information encompasses the full information life cycle
    which includes

    collection, generation, transformation, use, disclosure, retention, and disposal.
    A map of system

    and the

    owners or operators of the components. Understanding what personally identifiable
    information

    is being processed (e.g., the sensitivity of the personally identifiable information),
    how personally

    identifiable information is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible
    to the individual or is

    processed on the backend of the system), and by whom (e.g., individuals may have
    different

    privacy perceptions based on the entity that is processing the personally identifiable
    information)

    provides a number of contextual factors that are important to assessing the degree
    of privacy

    risk created by the system. The data map may be an overlay of any system design
    artifact that

    the organization is using. The development of this map may necessitate coordination

  discussion: >
    Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving

    continuity of operations for organizational missions and business functions. Contingency

    planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission
    or business

    processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered

    throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the
    system design.

    Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for
    resilience.

    Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational
    systems since not

    all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations
    desired. System

    recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
    policies,

    standards, and guidelines.

    In addition to availability, contingency plans address other security-related
    events resulting in a

    reduction in mission effectiveness including malicious attacks that compromise
    the integrity of

    systems or the confidentiality of information. Actions addressed in contingency
    plans include

    orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate
    information

    flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating

    contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that
    the necessary

    planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations
    consider

    whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability
    to automatically

    disable the system as specified in IR-4(5). Incident response planning is part
    of contingency

    planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response) family.

    Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,
    telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.
  discussion: >
    Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction

    of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended
    to support

    essential missions and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations

    during contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning.
    For

    capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for
    which the

    organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation,
    even if

    in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment
    of risk,

    system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance.

    The effect of system backup can be achieved by maintaining a redundant
    secondary system that mirrors the primary system, including the replication of information.
    If this type of redundancy is in place and there is sufficient geographic separation between

    organizations

    can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. The mechanisms

    to provide

    such alternative capabilities, the alternative or supplemental mechanisms are
    typically applied

    only to critical security capabilities provided by systems, system components,
    or system services.

    For example, an organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators

    Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique
    identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.
  discussion: >
    Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by

    complying with the requirements in [HSPD 12]. Organizational users include employees
    or

    individuals that organizations consider having equivalent status of employees
    (e.g., contractors

    and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies
    to all accesses

    other than accesses that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through
    the authorized

    use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes
    execute on behalf

    of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals
    in group

    accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.

    Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate
    user

    identities, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof.
    Access to

    organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local
    access is any

    access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users,
    where access is

    obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access
    is access to

    organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where
    access is obtained

    through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type
    of network access

    that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include
    local area

    networks and wide area networks.

    The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between
    organization-

    controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated
    as internal

    networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information
    traversing

    the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational
    users are

    described in IA-8.

    Out-of-band authentication refers to the use of two separate communication

    paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system.
    The first path

    (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices,
    and generally is

    the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band
    path) is

    used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example,
    a

    user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user
    desires

    access and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently,

    the server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested
    action

    originated from the user. The user may confirm the intended action to an individual
    on the

    telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. Out-of-band authentication

    can be used to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions

    Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the

    authenticator that is used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches,
    binding is

    established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the
    system. For

    example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e.,
    authenticator)

    is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the
    system. New

    authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator
    to

    be implemented external to a system. For example, with smartcard credentials,
    the identity

    and authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials,
    systems

    can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning
    the

    identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate

    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an

    An integrated incident response team is a team of experts that assesses,

    documents, and responds to incidents so that organizational systems and networks
    can

    recover quickly and can implement the necessary controls to avoid future incidents.
    Incident

    response team personnel include forensic and malicious code analysts, tool developers,

    systems security engineers, and real-time operations personnel. The incident handling

    capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis
    of and

    response to intrusions. For some organizations the incident response team can
    be a cross

    organizational entity.

    An integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows

    organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators), to leverage
    team

    knowledge of the threat and to implement defensive measures that enable organizations
    to

    deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid
    detection

    of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective

    defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated
    team can

    rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate
    the new

    incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence

    development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary

    tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or
    to specific

    missions and business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that
    does not

    disrupt those missions and business functions. Incident response teams can be

    incident response. Organizational missions and business functions help determine
    the structure

    of incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities,
    organizations

    consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations,
    including

    external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain.

  discussion: >
    Information spillage refers to instances where information is placed on systems
    that

    are not authorized to process such information. Information spills occur when
    information that is

    thought to be a certain classification or impact level is transmitted to a system
    and subsequently

    is determined to be of higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective
    action is

    required. The nature of the response is based upon the classification or impact
    level of the spilled

    information, the security capabilities of the system, the specific nature of contaminated
    storage

    media, and the access authorizations of individuals with authorized access to
    the contaminated

    system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the
    fact do not

    involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk
    of further spreading

    the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.

    Discussion: This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the MA family
    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

    boundaries but are used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational
    systems.

    Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for approval of maintenance

    transporting

    malicious code, intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently
    into systems.

    Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment
    and packet

    sniffers. The hardware and software components that support system maintenance
    and are a

    part of the system, including the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,”

    Perform preventive maintenance on <1> at <2>.
  discussion: >
    Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing of system

    components to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in satisfactory
    operating

    condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements,

    adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures
    either before

    they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive

    maintenance is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive

    maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing
    worn

    components before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other)
    failure

    management policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer recommendations;

    statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance that has already been
    conducted on

    similar equipment; requirements of codes, laws, or regulations within a jurisdiction;
    or

    measured values and performance indications.

    Perform predictive maintenance on <1> at <2>.
  discussion: >
    Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing

    periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive

    maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance
    activity

    is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold.
    The

    predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting
    the

    future trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach
    employs

    principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future
    maintenance

    activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed
    while

    equipment is in service, thus, minimizing disruption of normal system operations.
    Predictive

    maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.

    Discussion: Field maintenance is the type of maintenance conducted on a system
    or system

    component after the system or component has been deployed to a specific site (i.e.,
    operational

    environment). In certain instances, field maintenance (i.e., local maintenance
    at the site) may not

    be executed with the same degree of rigor or with the same quality control checks
    as depot

    maintenance. For critical systems designated as such by the organization, it may
    be necessary to

    restrict or prohibit field maintenance at the local site and require that such
    maintenance be

    conducted in trusted facilities with additional controls.

    Discussion: This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the MP family
    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

    security category or classification of the information.
  discussion: >
    Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject
    to

    disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples
    include digital

    media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network
    components,

    mobile devices, and non-digital media such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization
    process

    removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved
    or

    reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic
    erase, de-

    identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction, prevent
    the disclosure of

    information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released
    for disposal.

    Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that
    destruction is

    sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization.

    Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques
    and

    procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain
    or publicly

    releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or
    individuals if

    released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction,
    removing a

    classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected
    sections or

    words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner
    equivalent in

    effectiveness to removing them from the document. NARA policies controls the sanitization

    process for controlled unclassified information. NSA standards and policies control
    the

    sanitization process for media containing classified information.

    System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes

    diskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact disks, digital video disks, and
    removable hard

    disk drives. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Media use protections
    also apply to

    mobile devices with information storage capability. In contrast to MP-2, which
    restricts user

    access to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems,
    for example,

    restricting or prohibiting use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations
    use

    technical and nontechnical controls to restrict the use of system media. Organizations
    may

    restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages
    on workstations

    to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability
    to insert, read or

    write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage
    devices to only

    approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided
    by other

    approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations
    may

    restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, for
    example, prohibiting

    the use of writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction
    by disabling or

    removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners
    for storage

    devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to assign
    responsibility

    for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices.

    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

    an emergency

    power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection
    from

    unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy
    stored in

    batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of most UPS is

    Discussion: This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family
    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and

  discussion: >
    System security and privacy plans contain an overview of the security and privacy

    requirements for the system and the controls selected to satisfy the requirements.
    The plans

    describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the
    system with a

    sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently
    assess the

    effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific
    and

    hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality
    of

    the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and
    development of

    systems in support of life cycle-based security engineering processes. System
    security and privacy

    plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system
    development

    life cycle, for example, during capability determination, analysis of alternatives,
    requests for

    proposal, and design reviews. Section 2.1 describes the different types of requirements
    that are

    relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship
    between

    requirements and controls.

    Organizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain
    separate

    plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to
    a set of controls and

    control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements
    meet the

    security and privacy requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions
    of the

    design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and
    privacy plans

    contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter
    values for selection

    and assignment statements explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation

    that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations
    of

    risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
    and the Nation if

    the plan is implemented. Organizations can also apply the tailoring guidance to
    the control

    baselines in [SP 800-53B] to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address
    specialized

    requirements, technologies, missions, business applications, or environments of
    operation.

    Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection
    of various

    documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy
    plans make

    extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents,
    including design

    and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained.
    The use of

    references helps to reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy
    programs

    and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established
    management

    and operational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life
    cycle, systems

    engineering, and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed
    contingency

    plan or incident response plan information but instead can provide explicitly
    or by reference,

    sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.

    Security- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and planning
    with other

    individuals or groups within the organization include: assessments, audits, and
    inspections;

    hardware and software maintenance; patch management; and contingency plan testing.

    Planning and coordination includes emergency and nonemergency (i.e., planned or
    non-urgent

    unplanned) situations. The process defined by organizations to plan and coordinate
    security- and

    privacy-related activities can also be included other documents, as appropriate.

  discussion: >
    Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for organizational users.

    Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, conflict-of-interest

    agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see PS-6). Organizations consider rules
    of behavior

    based on individual user roles and responsibilities, and differentiating, for
    example, between

    rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing
    rules of

    behavior for some types of non-organizational users, including individuals who
    simply receive

    information from federal systems, is often not feasible given the large number
    of such users and

    the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for
    organizational and

    non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8. The related controls
    section provides a

    list of controls that are relevant to organizational rules of behavior. PL-4b,
    the documented

    acknowledgment portion of the control, may be satisfied by the awareness training
    and role-

    based training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules
    of behavior.

    Documented acknowledgements for rules of behavior include electronic or physical
    signatures;

    and electronic agreement check boxes or radio buttons.

    manner.
  discussion: >
    Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls in the security

    and privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome multiple controls
    to achieve

    their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple controls makes it more
    difficult to

    attack information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary; and
    increases

    the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential
    to ensure that

    an attack that involves one control does not create adverse unintended consequences
    by

    interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can include system lockout
    and

    cascading alarms. The placement of controls in systems and organizations is an
    important

    activity requiring thoughtful analysis. The value of organizational assets is
    an important

    consideration in providing additional layering. Defense-in-depth architectural
    approaches

    include modularity and layering (see SA-8(3)); separation of system and user functionality

    (see SC-2); and security function isolation (see SC-3).

    Information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses.

    Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For
    example,

    vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at
    different times,

    often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their
    priorities

    and development schedules. By deploying different products at different locations,
    there is

    an increased likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious
    code. With

    respect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally identifiable
    information

    in systems. Products may use different tracking methods. Using multiple products
    may result

    in more assurance that personally identifiable information is inventoried.

    Centrally manage <1>.

    Discussion: Central management refers to organization-wide management and implementation

    of selected controls and processes. This includes planning, implementing, assessing,
    authorizing,

    and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes.
    As the

    central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common
    (inherited)

    controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control
    implementations

    and management and judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally-managed
    controls and

    processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of
    initial and

    ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring.

    As part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls
    that may be

    suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not
    always possible to

    centrally manage every aspect of a control. In such cases, the control can be
    treated as a hybrid

    control with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level.
    The controls

    and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management
    include,

    but are not limited to: AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3), AC-2(4), AC-17(1), AC-17(2),

    Select a control baseline for the system.

    Discussion: Control baselines are pre-defined sets of controls specifically assembled
    to address

    the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls
    are chosen for

    baselines either to satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives,
    regulations,

    policies, standards, or guidelines; or to address threats common to all users
    of the baseline under

    the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point
    for the protection

    of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems, with subsequent
    tailoring actions

    to manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see
    PL-11). Federal

    control baselines are provided in [SP 800-53B]. The selection of a control baseline
    is determined

    by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business
    requirements

    and as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
    policies,

    regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in
    [SP 800-53B] are

    based on the requirements from [FISMA] and [PRIVACT]. The requirements, along
    with the NIST

    standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to
    select one of the

    control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information
    that is

    processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse
    impact of the

    loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization’s operations
    and assets,

    individuals, other organizations or the Nation; and considering the results from
    system and

    Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.

    Discussion: The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize
    a set of

    baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions
    facilitate such

    specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security
    and privacy plans

    that reflect their specific missions and business functions, the environments
    where their systems

    operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any
    other conditions or

    situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance
    is provided in [SP

    800-53B]. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating
    common

    controls; applying scoping considerations; selecting compensating controls; assigning
    values to

    control parameters; supplementing the control baseline with additional controls,
    as needed; and

    providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions
    in [SP 800-53B]

    can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations.
    Tailoring

    actions can be applied to the baselines in [SP 800-53B] in accordance with the
    security and

    privacy requirements from [FISMA] and [PRIVACT]. Alternatively, other communities
    of interest

    adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in [SP 800-53B]
    to specialize

    or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those
    entities.

    and

    Discussion: An information security program plan is a formal document that provides
    an

    overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information security
    program

    and describes the program management controls and common controls in place or
    planned for

    meeting those requirements. Information security program plans can be represented
    in single

    documents or compilations of documents.

    Information security program plans document the program management and common
    controls.

    The plans provide sufficient information about the controls (including specification
    of parameters

    for assignment and selection statements explicitly or by reference) to enable
    implementations

    that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination
    of the risk to

    be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.

    Program management controls are generally implemented at the organization level
    and are

    essential for managing the organization’s information security program. Program
    management

    controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because
    program

    management controls are independent of any particular information system. The
    individual

    system security plans and the organization-wide information security program plan
    together,

    provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the organization.

    Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information
    security

    program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for
    a system. The

    organization-wide information security program plan indicates which separate security
    plans

    contain descriptions of common controls.

    Information

    protection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine
    the required

    controls for the organization and the systems. Inherent in defining protection
    and personally

    identifiable information processing needs, is an understanding of adverse impact
    that could

    result if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process

    unintended

    consequences or a byproduct of authorized processing of information at any stage

    Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat

    Discussion: Organizations handling classified information are required, under
    Executive Order

    13587 [EO 13587] and the National Insider Threat Policy [ODNI NITP], to establish
    insider threat

    programs. The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs
    in classified

    environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled
    unclassified

    and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs
    include controls

    to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration
    and analysis

    of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider
    threat concerns. A

    senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible
    individual to

    implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized
    integration and

    analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare
    department or

    agency insider threat policies and implementation plans; conduct host-based user
    monitoring of

    individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers; provide
    insider threat

    awareness training to employees; receive access to information from offices in
    the department

    or agency for insider threat analysis; and conduct self-assessments of department
    or agency

    insider threat posture.

    Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams
    that organizations

    may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams.
    Human resources

    records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence
    to show that some

    types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace,
    including

    ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other
    colleagues.

    These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted
    monitoring efforts.

    However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for
    privacy. The

    participation of a legal team, including consultation with the senior agency official
    for privacy,

    monitoring activities and that those activities are coordinated. With the growing
    importance of

    continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of information security and
    privacy across

    the three levels of the risk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common
    controls,

    organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities
    that are routinely

    conducted as part of ongoing assessments supporting a variety of controls. Security
    and privacy

    training activities, while focused on individual systems and specific roles, require
    coordination

    across all organizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and
    activities are

    informed by current threat and vulnerability assessments.

    Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-
    sharing capability for threat intelligence.
  discussion: >
    Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,

    especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries
    can

    successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques
    to

    address this concern is for organizations to share threat information including
    threat events (i.e.,

    tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced; mitigations
    that

    organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats; and threat
    intelligence

    (i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may
    be bilateral or

    multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-to-

    government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking
    part in threat-

    sharing consortia. Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special
    agreements and

    protection, or less sensitive and freely shared.

    an

    overview of the agency’s privacy program, and:

    1.    Includes a description of the structure of the privacy program and the resources

    dedicated to the privacy program;

    2.    Provides an overview of the requirements for the privacy program and a description

    Nation; and

    b.   Update the plan to address changes in federal privacy laws and policy and
    organizational

    changes and problems identified during plan implementation or privacy control

    assessments.

    Discussion: A privacy program plan is a formal document that provides an overview
    of an

    organization’s privacy program, including a description of the structure of the
    privacy program;

    the resources dedicated to the privacy program; the role of the senior agency
    official for privacy

    and other privacy officials and staff; the strategic goals and objectives of the
    privacy program;

    and the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
    meeting

    applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks. Privacy program plans
    can be

    represented in single documents or compilations of documents.

    The senior agency official for privacy is responsible for designating which privacy
    controls the

    organization will treat as program management, common, system-specific, and hybrid
    controls.

    Privacy program plans provide sufficient information about the privacy program
    management

    and common controls (including the specification of parameters and assignment
    and selection

    statements explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that
    are unambiguously

    compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk incurred
    if the plans are

    implemented as intended.

    Program management controls are generally implemented at the organization level
    and are

    essential for managing the organization’s privacy program. Program management
    controls are

    distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management

    controls are independent of any particular information system. The privacy plans
    for individual

    systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan together, provide complete
    coverage

    for the privacy controls employed within the organization.

    Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s privacy program
    plan

    unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system. The
    organization-wide

    privacy program plan indicates which separate privacy plans contain descriptions
    of privacy

    controls.

    information, including:

    1.    Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure; and

    2.    Name and address, or other contact information of the person or organization
    to which

    the disclosure was made;

    b.   Retain the accounting of disclosures for the length of the time the personally
    identifiable

    information is maintained or five years after the disclosure is made, whichever
    is longer; and

    c.   Make the accounting of disclosures available to the individual to whom the
    personally

    identifiable information relates upon request.

    Discussion: The purpose of accounting of disclosures is to allow individuals to
    learn to whom

    their personally identifiable information has been disclosed; to provide a basis
    for subsequently

    advising recipients of any corrected or disputed personally identifiable information;
    and to

    provide an audit trail for subsequent reviews of organizational compliance with
    conditions for

    disclosures. For federal agencies, keeping an accounting of disclosures is required
    by the

    [PRIVACT]; agencies should consult with their senior agency official for privacy
    and legal counsel

    on this requirement and be aware of the statutory exceptions and OMB guidance
    relating to the

    provision.

    Organizations can use any system for keeping notations of disclosures, if it can
    construct from

    such a system, a document listing of all disclosures along with the required information.

    Automated mechanisms can be used by organizations to determine when personally
    identifiable

    information is disclosed, including commercial services providing notifications
    and alerts.

    Accounting of disclosures may also be used to help organizations verify compliance
    with

    applicable privacy statutes and policies governing disclosure or dissemination
    of information and

    dissemination restrictions.

    c.   Disseminating notice of corrected or deleted personally identifiable information
    to

    individuals or other appropriate entities; and

    d.   Appeals of adverse decisions on correction or deletion requests.

    Discussion: Personally identifiable information quality management include steps
    that

    organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable
    information

    throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the
    creation, collection,

    use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposition
    of personally

    identifiable information. Organizational policies and procedures for personally
    identifiable

    information quality management are important because inaccurate or outdated personally

    identifiable information maintained by organizations may cause problems for individuals.

    Organizations consider the quality of personally identifiable information involved
    in business

    functions where inaccurate information may result in adverse decisions or the
    denial of benefits

    and services, or the disclosure of the information may cause stigmatization. Correct
    information,

    in certain circumstances, can cause problems for individuals that outweigh the
    benefits of

    organizations maintaining the information. Organizations consider creating policies
    and

    procedures for the removal of such information.

    The senior agency official for privacy ensures that practical means and mechanisms
    exist and are

    accessible for individuals or their authorized representatives to seek the correction
    or deletion of

    personally identifiable information. Processes for correcting or deleting data
    are clearly defined

    and publicly available. Organizations use discretion in determining whether data
    is to be deleted

    or corrected based on the scope of requests, the changes sought, and the impact
    of the changes.

    Additionally, processes include the provision of responses to individuals of decisions
    to deny

    requests for correction or deletion. The responses include the reasons for the
    decisions, a means

    to record individual objections to the decisions, and a means of requesting reviews
    of the initial

    determinations.

    Organizations notify individuals or their designated representatives when their
    personally

    identifiable information is corrected or deleted to provide transparency and confirm
    the

    completed action. Due to complexity of data flows and storage, other entities
    may need to be

    informed of correction or deletion. Notice supports the consistent correction
    and deletion of

    personally identifiable information across the data ecosystem.

    Discussion: Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing
    awareness of the

    security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational
    risk management

    decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and
    monitor their

    controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions.
    Different types of

    controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous
    monitoring

    guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring
    programs allow

    organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in
    highly dynamic

    environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities,

    and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on

    Analyze <1> supporting

    mission essential services or functions to ensure that the information resources
    are being used

    consistent with their intended purpose.

    Discussion: Systems are designed to support a specific mission or business function.
    However,

    over time, systems and system components may be used to support services and functions
    that

    are outside the scope of the intended mission or business functions. This can
    result in exposing

    information resources to unintended environments and uses that can significantly
    increase

    threat exposure. In doing so, the systems are in turn more vulnerable to compromise,
    and can

    ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended. This
    is especially

    impactful for mission essential services and functions. By analyzing resource
    use, organizations

    can identify such potential exposures.

    Discussion: This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the PS family
    implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
    factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures help provide security
    and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

    a.   Assign a risk designation to all organizational positions;

    b.   Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and

    c.   Review and update position risk designations <1>.

    Discussion: Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management
    (OPM) policy and

    guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent
    suitability

    and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses
    the duties and

    responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to
    the efficiency or

    integrity of the service from misconduct of an incumbent of a position. This establishes
    the risk

    level of that position. This assessment also determines if a position’s duties
    and responsibilities

    present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse
    effect on the

    national security, and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes
    the sensitivity level of

    a position. The results of this assessment determine what level of investigation
    is conducted for a

    position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations individuals
    receive

    when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening
    criteria

    include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400
    and 731 of Title

    5, Code of Federal Regulations establish the requirements for organizations to
    evaluate relevant

    covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate
    with the

    duties and responsibilities of those positions.

    information to only that which is authorized.
  discussion: >
    Processing of personally identifiable information is an operation or set of operations

    that the information system or organization performs with respect to personally
    identifiable

    information across the information life cycle. Processing includes, but is not
    limited to, creation,

    collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure,
    and disposal.

    Processing operations also include logging, generation, and transformation, as
    well as analysis

    techniques, such as data mining.

    Organizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
    or policies that

    establish the organization’s authority and thereby limit certain types of processing
    of personally

    identifiable information or establish other requirements related to the processing.
    Organizational

    personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel
    regarding such

    authority, particularly if the organization is subject to multiple jurisdictions
    or sources of

    authority. For organizations whose processing is not determined according to legal
    authorities,

    the organizations’ policies and determinations govern how they process personally
    identifiable

    information. While processing of personally identifiable information may be legally
    permissible,

    privacy risks may still arise from its processing. Privacy risk assessments can
    identify the privacy

    risks associated with the authorized processing of personally identifiable information
    and

    support solutions to manage such risks.

    Organizations consider applicable requirements and organizational policies to
    determine how to

    document this authority. For federal agencies, the authority to process personally
    identifiable

    information is documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices,
    privacy

    impact assessments, [PRIVACT] statements, computer matching agreements and notices,

    contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, and/or
    other

    documentation.

    Organizations take steps to ensure that personally identifiable information is
    processed only for

    authorized purposes, including training organizational personnel on the authorized
    processing of

    personally identifiable information and monitoring and auditing organizational
    use of personally

    identifiable information.

  discussion: >
    Identifying and documenting the purpose for processing provides organizations
    with

    a basis for understanding why personally identifiable information may be processed.
    The term

    process includes every step of the information life cycle, including creation,
    collection, use,

    processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal. Identifying
    and

    documenting the purpose of processing is a prerequisite to enabling owners and
    operators of the

    system, and individuals whose information is processed by the system, to understand
    how the

    information will be processed. This enables individuals to make informed decisions
    about their

    engagement with information systems and organizations, and to manage their privacy
    interests.

    Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described
    in the

    organization’s privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation,

    including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, [PRIVACT] statements,

    computer matching notices, and other applicable Federal Register notices.

    for identified purposes, including training organizational personnel and monitoring
    and auditing

    organizational processing of personally identifiable information.

    Organizations monitor for changes in personally identifiable information processing.

    Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and
    legal counsel to

    ensure that any new purposes arising from changes in processing are compatible
    with the

    purpose for which the information was collected, or if the new purpose is not
    compatible,

    implement mechanisms in accordance with defined requirements to allow for the
    new

    processing, if appropriate. Mechanisms may include obtaining consent from individuals,
    revising

    privacy policies, or other measures to manage privacy risks arising from changes
    in personally

    identifiable information processing purposes.

  discussion: >
    Consent allows individuals to participate in the decision-making about the processing

    of their information and transfers some of the risk that arises from the processing
    of personally

    identifiable information from the organization to an individual. Organizations
    consider whether

    other controls may more effectively mitigate privacy risk either alone or in conjunction
    with

    consent. Consent may be required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
    regulations,

    policies, standards, or guidelines. Otherwise, when selecting this control, organizations
    consider

    whether individuals can be reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy
    risks

    arising from their authorization. Organizations also consider any demographic
    or contextual

    factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of individuals with respect
    to the data

    actions carried out by the system or organization. When soliciting consent from
    individuals,

    organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for obtaining consent, including
    how to

    properly authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent
    through

    electronic means. In addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for
    individuals to

    revoke consent once it has been provided, as appropriate. Finally, organizations
    consider

    usability factors to help individuals understand the risks being accepted when
    providing consent,

    including the use of plain language and avoiding technical jargon.

    identifiable information is processed, as well as other information such as choices
    individuals

    might have with respect to that processing and, other parties with whom information

    Privacy risk assessments identify the privacy risks associated with the processing
    of personally

    identifiable information and may help organizations determine appropriate elements
    to include

    retrieved by the

    name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier.

    of records

    maintained in the system, the categories of individuals about whom records are

    A [PRIVACT] routine use is a particular kind of disclosure of a record outside

    the prior

    written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. To qualify as a
    routine use,

    the disclosure must be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which
    the

    information was originally collected. The [PRIVACT] requires agencies to describe
    each

    routine use of the records maintained in the system of records, including the
    categories of

    users of the records and the purpose of the use. Agencies may only establish routine
    uses by

    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and

    Security

    categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security
    engineering

    processes carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations
    can use

    privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand the
    potential

    adverse effects on individuals.

    Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide
    activity with

    the direct involvement of chief information officers, senior agency information
    security officers,

    senior agency officials for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners,

    Organizations apply the “high water mark” concept to each system categorized

    in accordance with [FIPS 199] resulting in systems designated as low impact, moderate

    impact, or high impact. Organizations desiring additional granularity in the system
    impact

    designations for risk-based decision making, can further partition the systems
    into sub-

    categories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level
    prioritization on

    a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems,

    moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization
    and

    the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to
    focus their

    investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control

    determine

    those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent
    a

    critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets.
    For such

    high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation,

    Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk

    assessments. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and
    impact to

    organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
    Nation based on

    the operation and use of systems. Risk assessments also consider risk from external
    parties,

    including individuals accessing organizational systems; contractors operating
    systems on behalf

    of the organization; service providers; and outsourcing entities.

    Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management
    hierarchy

    (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system
    level) and at any

    stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted
    at various

    steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, control selection,
    control

    implementation, control assessment, system authorization, and control monitoring.
    Risk

    assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development
    life cycle.

    In addition to the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system,
    risk

    assessments can also address any information related to the system, including
    system design, the

    intended use of the system, testing results, and other supply chain-related information
    or

    artifacts. Assessments of risk can play an important role in control selection
    processes,

    particularly during the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest
    phases of capability

    determination.

  discussion: >
    Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and

    comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations
    determine the

    required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential
    sources of

    vulnerabilities such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, sensors),
    networked

    printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The capability to readily
    update vulnerability

    monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced, and as new
    scanning

    methods are developed, helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed
    by employed

    vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process
    helps to ensure

    that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly
    as possible.

    Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional
    approaches

    such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the
    three approaches.

    Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in
    a variety of tools,

    including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.

    Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions,
    ports,

    protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and
    scanning for flow

    control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability

    monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use
    instrumentation

    to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy
    and

    may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring
    tools that

    facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated
    Protocol (SCAP)

    validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities
    in the

    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the
    Open

    Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities.
    Sources

    for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing
    and the

    National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises
    provide

    additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations
    also consider using

    scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring
    System

    (CVSS).

    Vulnerability monitoring also includes a channel and process for receiving reports
    of security

    vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can
    be as simple as

    publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including
    notification

    authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations
    generally

    expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization, and
    can use public

    vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities
    are

    reported directly to the organization for remediation.

    Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as “bug
    bounties”) to

    further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities.
    Bug bounty

    programs can be tailored to the organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated
    indefinitely or

    over a defined period of time, and can be offered to the general public or to
    a curated group.

    Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously, and could choose
    to offer

    partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security
    vulnerabilities

    from privileged vantage points.

    1.   Will be processed using information technology; and

    contacting

    of a specific individual, if identical questions have been posed to, or identical
    reporting

    requirements imposed on, ten or more persons, other than agencies, instrumentalities,

    or employees of the federal government.

    Discussion: A privacy impact assessment is an analysis of how personally identifiable
    information

    is handled to ensure that handling conforms to applicable privacy requirements,
    determine the

    privacy risks associated with an information system or activity, and evaluate
    ways to mitigate

    privacy risks. A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document
    detailing

    the process and the outcome of the analysis.

    Organizations conduct and develop a privacy impact assessment with sufficient
    clarity and

    specificity to demonstrate that the organization fully considered privacy and
    incorporated

    appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the organization’s
    activity and

    throughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful privacy
    impact

    assessment, the organization’s senior agency official for privacy works closely
    with program

    managers, system owners, information technology experts, security officials, counsel,
    and other

    relevant organization personnel. Moreover, a privacy impact assessment is not
    a time-restricted

    activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information
    system or personally

    identifiable information life cycles. Rather, the privacy analysis continues throughout
    the system

    and personally identifiable information life cycles. Accordingly, a privacy impact
    assessment is a

    living document that organizations update whenever changes to the information
    technology,

    changes to the organization’s practices, or other factors alter the privacy risks
    associated with

    the use of such information technology.

    To conduct the privacy impact assessment, organizations can use security and privacy
    risk

    assessments. Organizations may also use other related processes which may have
    different

    labels, including privacy threshold analyses. A privacy impact assessment can
    also serve as notice

    to the public regarding the organization’s practices with respect to privacy.
    Although conducting

    and publishing privacy impact assessments may be required by law, organizations
    may develop

    such policies in the absence of applicable laws. For federal agencies, privacy
    impact assessments

    may be required by [EGOV]; agencies should consult with their senior agency official
    for privacy

    and legal counsel on this requirement and be aware of the statutory exceptions
    and OMB

    guidance relating to the provision.

    Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality
    analysis for

    <1> at

    <2>.

    Discussion: Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require
    significant

    protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain
    risk management, and

    informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical
    system components

    and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders regulations, directives,
    policies, and

    standards; system functionality requirements; system and component interfaces;
    and system

    and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition
    of a

    system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition

    includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system;
    decomposition

    into the specific functions to perform those missions; and traceability to the
    hardware, software,

    and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions
    are

    shared by many components within and external to the system.

    The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality,

    including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices,
    system-of-

    systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access
    to critical

    system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities
    such

    components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of
    the impact of a

    component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported
    by the system

    containing the components and functions. Criticality analysis is performed when
    an architecture

    or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed
    early in the

    system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system
    design to reduce

    the critical nature of these components and functions, for example, by adding
    redundancy or

    alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence
    the protection

    measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis
    for systems,

    system components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is
    an important

    consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security categorization in

    unusual file

    changes, and the presence of malicious code. Threat hunting teams leverage existing
    threat

    intelligence and may create new threat intelligence, which is shared with peer

  discussion: >
    A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful

    development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. The integration
    of

    security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle
    is a foundational

    principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the
    required controls

    within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information
    security

    and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions
    and business

    functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly
    design, code, and

    test systems and system components. Organizations include in system development
    life cycle

    processes, qualified personnel, including senior agency information security officers,
    senior

    agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and
    privacy engineers to

    ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into
    organizational

    systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals
    having

    key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills,
    and expertise to

    conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.

    The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise
    architecture also

    helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed
    throughout the

    system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational
    mission and

    business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information
    security and

    privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with risk management
    strategy

    of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple
    organizations,

    (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, and service providers), acquisition
    and supply

    chain risk management functions and controls play a significant role in the effective
    management

    of the system during the life cycle.

    Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or operational

    of such

    information. Thus, it is important for the organization to manage any additional
    risks that

    may result from use of live or operational data. Organizations can minimize such
    risk by

    using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems,

  discussion: >
    Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-

    level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements
    include

    security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements
    associated

    with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness,
    completeness,

    resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance
    requirements

    include development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and the
    evidence

    from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that
    the required

    functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism.
    [SP 800-160 v1]

    describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development
    life cycle.

    Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities
    appropriate

    for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization
    and reflecting the

    security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented
    in

    order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational
    responsibilities.

    Controls can include technical aspects, administrative aspects, and physical aspects.
    In some

    cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional
    specification by

    the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter
    values.

    The derived requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide
    the

    appropriate level of implementation detail for controls within the system development
    life cycle.

    Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system
    development

    life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation
    and

    operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based
    on the security

    categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations
    depend

    on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations.
    Requirements

    can include mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,
    protocols, and

    services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services
    are defined in

    the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.

  discussion: >
    Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and
    are

    implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3). Organizations
    can apply

    systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development
    or to

    systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems
    security and

    privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent
    feasible, given

    the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those
    systems.

    The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles help organizations
    develop

    trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility to disruptions,
    hazards,

    threats, and creating privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system security
    engineering

    principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and
    privacy policies,

    architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating
    security

    and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical
    and logical

    security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure
    software;

    tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; performing threat modeling to
    identify use cases,

    threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating
    controls needed

    to mitigate risk.

    Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and
    principles can

    facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components,
    and services;

    reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions.

  text: Implement the security design principle of clear abstractions.
  discussion: >
    The principle of clear abstractions states that a system has simple, well-defined

    interfaces and functions that provide a consistent and intuitive view of the data
    and how it is

    managed. The elegance (e.g., clarity, simplicity, necessity, and sufficiency)
    of the system

    interfaces, combined with a precise definition of their functional behavior promotes
    ease of

    analysis, inspection, and testing as well as the correct and secure use of the
    system. The

    clarity of an abstraction is subjective. Examples reflecting application of this
    principle include

    avoidance of redundant, unused interfaces; information hiding; and avoidance of
    semantic

    overloading of interfaces or their parameters (e.g., not using a single function
    to provide

    different functionality, depending on how it is used). Information hiding, also
    known as

    representation-independent programming, is a design discipline to ensure that
    the internal

    representation of information in one system component is not visible to another
    system

    component invoking or calling the first component, such that the published abstraction
    is

    not influenced by how the data may be managed internally.

    Implement the security design principle of least common mechanism in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of least common mechanism states that the amount of mechanism

    common to more than one user and depended on by all users is minimized [POPEK74].

    Minimization of mechanism implies that different components of a system refrain
    from

    using the same mechanism to access a system resource. Every shared mechanism (especially

    a mechanism involving shared variables) represents a potential information path
    between

    users and is designed with great care to be sure it does not unintentionally compromise

    security [SALTZER75]. Implementing the principle of least common mechanism helps
    to

    reduce the adverse consequences of sharing system state among different programs.
    A

    single program corrupting a shared state (including shared variables) has the
    potential to

    corrupt other programs that are dependent on the state. The principle of least
    common

    mechanism also supports the principle of simplicity of design and addresses the
    issue of

    covert storage channels [LAMPSON73].

    Implement the security design principles of modularity and layering in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principles of modularity and layering are fundamental across system

    engineering disciplines. Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition
    are

    effective in managing system complexity, by making it possible to comprehend the
    structure

    of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging
    and

    resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions
    and related

    data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships
    of these

    units to be better understood, so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity
    can

    be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity
    to

    include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security
    policy.

    Security-informed modular decomposition includes the following: allocation of
    policies to

    systems in a network; separation of system applications into processes with distinct
    address

    spaces; allocation of system policies to layers; and separation of processes into
    subjects with

    distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains.

    Implement the security design principle of partially ordered dependencies in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of partially ordered dependencies states that the synchronization,

    calling, and other dependencies in the system are partially ordered. A fundamental
    concept

    in system design is layering, whereby the system is organized into well-defined,
    functionally

    related modules or components. The layers are linearly ordered with respect to
    inter-layer

    dependencies, such that higher layers are dependent on lower layers. While providing

    functionality to higher layers, some layers can be self-contained and not dependent
    upon

    lower layers. While a partial ordering of all functions in a given system may
    not be possible,

    if circular dependencies are constrained to occur within layers, the inherent
    problems of

    circularity can be more easily managed. Partially ordered dependencies and system
    layering

    contribute significantly to the simplicity and the coherency of the system design.
    Partially

    ordered dependencies also facilitate system testing and analysis.

    Implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of efficiently mediated access states that policy-enforcement

    mechanisms utilize the least common mechanism available while satisfying stakeholder

    requirements within expressed constraints. The mediation of access to system resources

    (i.e., CPU, memory, devices, communication ports, services, infrastructure, data
    and

    information) is often the predominant security function of secure systems. It
    also enables

    the realization of protections for the capability provided to stakeholders by
    the system.

    Mediation of resource access can result in performance bottlenecks if the system
    is not

    designed correctly. For example, by using hardware mechanisms, efficiently mediated
    access

    can be achieved. Once access to a low-level resource such as memory has been obtained,

    hardware protection mechanisms can ensure that out-of-bounds access does not occur.

    Implement the security design principle of minimized sharing in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of minimized sharing states that no computer resource is shared

    between system components (e.g., subjects, processes, functions) unless it is
    absolutely

    necessary to do so. Minimized sharing helps to simplify system design and implementation.

    In order to protect user-domain resources from arbitrary active entities, no resource
    is

    shared unless that sharing has been explicitly requested and granted. The need
    for resource

    sharing can be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in
    the case

    internal entities, or driven by stakeholder requirements. However, internal sharing
    is

    carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage- and timing-channel
    problems.

    Sharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility of data and information
    to

    unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification and can adversely affect
    the inherent

    capability provided by the system. To minimize sharing induced by common mechanisms,

    such mechanisms can be designed to be reentrant or virtualized to preserve separation.

    Moreover, use of global data to share information is carefully scrutinized. The
    lack of

    encapsulation may obfuscate relationships among the sharing entities.

    Implement the security design principle of reduced complexity in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design is as simple

    and small as possible. A small and simple design is more understandable, more
    analyzable,

    and less prone to error. The reduced complexity principle applies to any aspect
    of a system,

    but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed
    to obtain

    evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses
    to be

    successful, a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle
    of reduced

    complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness

    and completeness of system security functions. It also facilitates identification
    of potential

    vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity
    of the system is

    directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain—that is, simpler
    systems

    contain fewer vulnerabilities. An important benefit of reduced complexity is that
    it is easier

    to understand whether the intended security policy has been captured in the system
    design,

    and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering
    development.

    An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness,
    and

    existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance
    in contrast to

    conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex.

    Transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning
    from IPv4 to

    IPv6) may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously
    during the

    transition period. This may result in a temporary increase in system complexity
    during the

    transition.

    The principle of secure evolvability states that a system is developed to facilitate

    the maintenance of its security properties when there are changes to the system’s
    structure,

    interfaces, interconnections (i.e., system architecture), functionality, or its
    configuration (i.e.,

    security policy enforcement). Changes include a new, an enhanced, or an upgraded
    system

    capability; maintenance and sustainment activities; and reconfiguration. Although
    it is not

    possible to plan for every aspect of system evolution, system upgrades and changes
    can be

    anticipated by analyses of mission or business strategic direction; anticipated
    changes in the

    threat environment; and anticipated maintenance and sustainment needs. It is unrealistic
    to

    expect that complex systems remain secure in contexts not envisioned during development,

    whether such contexts are related to the operational environment or to usage.
    A system

    may be secure in some new contexts, but there is no guarantee that its emergent
    behavior

    will always be secure. It is easier to build trustworthiness into a system from
    the outset, and

    it follows that the sustainment of system trustworthiness requires planning for
    change as

    opposed to adapting in an ad hoc or non-methodical manner. The benefits of this
    principle

    include reduced vendor life-cycle costs; reduced cost of ownership; improved system

    security; more effective management of security risk; and less risk uncertainty.

    Implement the security design principle of trusted components in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of trusted components states that a component is trustworthy to

    at least a level commensurate with the security dependencies it supports (i.e.,
    how much it

    is trusted to perform its security functions by other components). This principle
    enables the

    composition of components such that trustworthiness is not inadvertently diminished
    and

    where consequently the trust is not misplaced. Ultimately this principle demands
    some

    metric by which the trust in a component and the trustworthiness of a component
    can be

    measured on the same abstract scale. The principle of trusted components is particularly

    relevant when considering systems and components in which there are complex chains
    of

    trust dependencies. A trust dependency is also referred to as a trust relationship
    and there

    may be chains of trust relationships.

    The principle of trusted components also applies to a compound component that
    consists of

    subcomponents (e.g., a subsystem), which may have varying levels of trustworthiness.
    The

    conservative assumption is that the trustworthiness of a compound component is
    that of its

    least trustworthy subcomponent. It may be possible to provide a security engineering

    rationale that the trustworthiness of a particular compound component is greater
    than the

    conservative assumption; however, any such rationale reflects logical reasoning
    based on a

    clear statement of the trustworthiness objectives, and relevant and credible evidence.
    The

    trustworthiness of a compound component is not the same as increased application
    of

    defense-in-depth layering within the component, or replication of components.
    Defense-in-

    depth techniques do not increase the trustworthiness of the whole above that of
    the least

    trustworthy component.

    Implement the security design principle of hierarchical trust in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of hierarchical trust for components builds on the principle of

    trusted components and states that the security dependencies in a system will
    form a partial

    ordering if they preserve the principle of trusted components. The partial ordering
    provides

    the basis for trustworthiness reasoning or providing an assurance case or argument
    when

    composing a secure system from heterogeneously trustworthy components. To analyze
    a

    system composed of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness,
    it is

    essential to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness.
    If a more

    trustworthy component located in a lower layer of the system were to depend upon
    a less

    trustworthy component in a higher layer, this would in effect, put the components
    in the

    same “less trustworthy” equivalence class per the principle of trusted components.
    Trust

    relationships, or chains of trust, can have various manifestations. For example,
    the root

    certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy,
    whereas the

    leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs
    in a

    layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware
    base),

    which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy component.
    The

    principle of hierarchical trust, however, does not prohibit the use of overly
    trustworthy

    components. There may be cases in a system of low trustworthiness, where it is
    reasonable

    to employ a highly trustworthy component rather than one that is less trustworthy
    (e.g., due

    to availability or other cost-benefit driver). For such a case, any dependency
    of the highly

    trustworthy component upon a less trustworthy component does not degrade the

    trustworthiness of the resulting low-trust system.

    The principle of hierarchical protection states that a component need not be

    component, it protects itself from all other components. For example, if an operating

    kernel is deemed the most trustworthy component in a system, then it protects

    for

    applying the principle of hierarchical protection. A trusted system need not protect

    from an equally trustworthy user, reflecting use of untrusted systems in “system
    high”

    The principle of minimized security elements states that the system does not

    has two

    aspects: the overall cost of security analysis and the complexity of security
    analysis. Trusted

    components are generally costlier to construct and implement, owing to increased
    rigor of

    development processes. Trusted components also require greater security analysis
    to qualify

    their trustworthiness. Thus, to reduce the cost and decrease the complexity of
    the security

    analysis, a system contains as few trustworthy components as possible. The analysis
    of the

    interaction of trusted components with other components of the system is one of
    the most

    important aspects of system security verification. If the interactions between
    components

    are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also be more difficult
    to ascertain

    than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed.

    Implement the security design principle of least privilege in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of least privilege states that each system component is allocated

    sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions, but no more. Applying
    the principle

    of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two
    desirable

    effects: the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component
    will have a

    minimized security impact; and the security analysis of the component will be
    simplified.

    Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the
    secure system

    design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain
    subsets

    of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity
    of

    privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there
    may be an

    interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface
    for the audit

    operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally,
    yet another

    interface for the audit reviewer, who has need only to view the audit data that
    has been

    collected but no need to perform operations on that data.

    In addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can
    be used as a

    guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect
    of internal least

    privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the
    module are

    directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to
    a module

    that may be affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through
    interaction

    (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another
    aspect of

    internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes
    only those

    system elements that are necessary for its functionality, and that the access
    modes for the

    elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal.

    The principle of continuous protection states that components and data used to

    the security

    policy and the security architecture assumptions. No assurances that the system
    can provide

    the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy protections for its
    design capability can

    be made if there are gaps in the protection. Any assurances about the ability
    to secure a

    delivered capability require that data and information are continuously protected.
    That is,

    there are no periods during which data and information are left unprotected while
    under

    control of the system (i.e., during the creation, storage, processing, or communication
    of the

    data and information, as well as during system initialization, execution, failure,
    interruption,

    and shutdown). Continuous protection requires adherence to the precepts of the
    reference

    monitor concept (i.e., every request is validated by the reference monitor, the
    reference

    monitor is able to protect itself from tampering, and sufficient assurance of
    the correctness

    and completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing),
    and the

    principle of secure failure and recovery (i.e., preservation of a secure state
    during error,

    fault, failure, and successful attack; preservation of a secure state during recovery
    to normal,

    degraded, or alternative operational modes).

    Continuous protection also applies to systems designed to operate in varying configurations,

    including those that deliver full operational capability and degraded-mode configurations

    that deliver partial operational capability. The continuous protection principle
    requires that

    changes to the system security policies be traceable to the operational need that
    drives the

    configuration and be verifiable (i.e., it is possible to verify that the proposed
    changes will not

    put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability and verification
    may lead to

    inconsistent states or protection discontinuities due to the complex or undecidable
    nature of

    the problem. The use of pre-verified configuration definitions that reflect the
    new security

    policy enables analysis to determine that a transition from old to new policies
    is essentially

    atomic, and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not
    conflict with

    the new policy. The ability to demonstrate continuous protection is rooted in
    the clear

    articulation of life cycle protection needs as stakeholder security requirements.

    Implement the security design principle of secure metadata management in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of secure metadata management states that metadata are “first

    class” objects with respect to security policy when the policy requires complete
    protection of

    information or it requires that the security subsystem to be self-protecting.
    The principle of

    secure metadata management is driven by the recognition that a system, subsystem,
    or

    component cannot achieve self-protection unless it protects the data it relies
    upon for

    correct execution. Data is generally not interpreted by the system that stores
    it. It may have

    semantic value (i.e., it comprises information) to users and programs that process
    the data.

    In contrast, metadata is information about data, such as a file name or the date
    when the

    file was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a
    way that the

    system can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its
    target data.

    There may be metadata whose target is itself metadata (e.g., the sensitivity level
    of a file

    name), to include self-referential metadata.

    The apparent secondary nature of metadata can lead to a neglect of its legitimate
    need for

    protection, resulting in a violation of the security policy that includes the
    exfiltration of

    information. A particular concern associated with insufficient protections for
    metadata is

    associated with multilevel secure (MLS) systems. MLS systems mediate access by
    a subject to

    an object based on relative sensitivity levels. It follows that all subjects and
    objects in the

    scope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly attributed
    with

    sensitivity levels. The corollary of labeled metadata for MLS systems states that
    objects

    containing metadata are labeled. As with protection needs assessment for data,
    attention is

    given to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity protections are individually
    assessed,

    specified, and allocated to metadata, as would be done for mission, business,
    and system

    data.

    The principle of self-analysis states that a system component is able to assess
    its

    internal state and functionality to a limited extent at various stages of execution,
    and that

    this self-analysis capability is commensurate with the level of trustworthiness
    invested in the

    system. At the system level, self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical
    assessments

    of trustworthiness established in a bottom up fashion. In this approach, the lower-level

    components check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent)
    of higher-

    level components. For example, trusted boot sequences involve a trusted lower-level

    component attesting to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level components
    so that a

    transitive chain of trust can be established. At the root, a component attests
    to itself, which

    usually involves an axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its
    integrity.

    Results of the self-analyses can be used to guard against externally induced errors,
    or

    internal malfunction or transient errors. By following this principle, some simple
    errors or

    malfunctions can be detected without allowing the effects of the error or malfunction
    to

    propagate outside the component. Further, the self-test can also be used to attest

    Implement the security design principle of accountability and traceability in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of accountability and traceability states that it is possible to
    trace

    security-relevant actions (i.e., subject-object interactions) to the entity on
    whose behalf the

    action is being taken. The principle of accountability and traceability requires
    a trustworthy

    infrastructure that can record details about actions that affect system security
    (e.g., an audit

    subsystem). To record the details about actions, the system is able to uniquely
    identify the

    entity on whose behalf the action is being carried out and also record the relevant
    sequence

    of actions that are carried out. The accountability policy also requires the audit
    trail itself be

    protected from unauthorized access and modification. The principle of least privilege
    assists

    in tracing the actions to particular entities, as it increases the granularity
    of accountability.

    Associating specific actions with system entities, and ultimately with users,
    and making the

    audit trail secure against unauthorized access and modifications provides non-repudiation,

    because once an action is recorded, it is not possible to change the audit trail.
    Another

    important function that accountability and traceability serves is in the routine
    and forensic

    analysis of events associated with the violation of security policy. Analysis
    of audit logs may

    provide additional information that may be helpful in determining the path or
    component

    that allowed the violation of the security policy, and the actions of individuals
    associated

    with the violation of security policy.

    Implement the security design principle of secure defaults in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of secure defaults states that the default configuration of a system

    (to include its constituent subsystems, components, and mechanisms) reflects a
    restrictive

    and conservative enforcement of security policy. The principle of secure defaults
    applies to

    the initial (i.e., default) configuration of a system as well as to the security
    engineering and

    design of access control and other security functions that follow a “deny unless
    explicitly

    authorized” strategy. The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires
    that any “as

    shipped” configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does not aid
    in the

    violation of the security policy, and can prevent the system from operating in
    the default

    configuration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration
    by the

    operational user.

    Restrictive defaults mean that the system will operate “as-shipped” with adequate
    self-

    protection, and is able to prevent security breaches before the intended security
    policy and

    system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by
    the “as-

    shipped” product is inadequate, stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior
    to establishing a

    secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees
    that a system is

    established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In
    situations where

    the system fails to complete initialization, either it will perform a requested
    operation using

    secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles
    of continuous

    protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide
    the ability to

    detect and recover from failure.

    The security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms
    deny

    requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the
    security

    policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless it is shown to be
    inconsistent

    with the policy. In a large system, the conditions that are satisfied to grant
    a request that is

    by default denied are often far more compact and complete than those that would
    need to

    be checked in order to deny a request that is by default granted.

    Implement the security design principle of secure failure and recovery in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of secure failure and recovery states that neither a failure in
    a

    system function or mechanism nor any recovery action in response to failure leads
    to a

    violation of security policy. The principle of secure failure and recovery parallels
    the principle

    of continuous protection to ensure that a system is capable of detecting (within
    limits) actual

    and impending failure at any stage of its operation (i.e., initialization, normal
    operation,

    shutdown, and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security
    policies

    are not violated. In addition, when specified, the system is capable of recovering
    from

    impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, or alternative secure
    operation

    while ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are
    not violated.

    Failure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its
    specified or

    expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function
    is

    detected, the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component,
    while

    maintaining security, and provide all or part of the functionality of the original
    system, or

    completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies.
    For this to

    occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous

    enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.

    Another technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback
    to a

    secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace
    the service

    or component that failed such that secure operation may resume. Failure of a component

    may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure
    failure

    indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access.
    For example,

    a nominally “atomic” operation interrupted before completion does not violate
    security

    policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level
    atomicity and

    rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a service is being used, its atomicity
    properties

    are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of
    that service

    can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example, a system
    is designed

    to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data
    consistency

    after disconnection.

    Failure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms,

    sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue in a secure
    state even

    when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar,

    however, the additional protection may be illusory, as the adversary can simply
    attack in

    series. Similarly, in a networked system, breaking the security on one system
    or service may

    enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services.
    By

    employing multiple protection mechanisms, whose features are significantly different,
    the

    possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted
    to

    weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource

    usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses
    are

    conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as could be the case
    for

    dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When
    a

    resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical to detect and repair
    any security

    breaches before the resource is once again used in a secure context.

    Implement the security design principle of performance security in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of performance security states that security mechanisms are

    constructed so that they do not degrade system performance unnecessarily. Stakeholder

    and system design requirements for performance and security are precisely articulated
    and

    prioritized. For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and
    be found

    acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation against stakeholder requirements),
    the designers

    adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on
    protection

    needs. The overall impact of computationally intensive security services (e.g.,
    cryptography)

    are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority
    performance

    considerations or are deemed to be providing an acceptable trade-off of performance
    for

    trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally
    intensive

    security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency
    of a security

    service is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The
    strength of

    mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements as well as performance-critical

    overhead issues (e.g., cryptographic key management) and an assessment of the
    capability

    of the threat.

    The principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that
    help in the

    enforcement of security policy, but incur minimum overhead, such as low-level
    hardware

    mechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms
    are

    usually very specific, have very limited functionality, and are optimized for
    performance. For

    example, once access rights to a portion of memory is granted, many systems use
    hardware

    mechanisms to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address
    and

    access mode. Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security
    into the

    system from the ground up, and to incorporate simple mechanisms at the lower layers
    that

    can be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms.

    Implement the security design principle of human factored security in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of human factored security states that the user interface for

    security functions and supporting services is intuitive, user friendly, and provides
    feedback

    for user actions that affect such policy and its enforcement. The mechanisms that
    enforce

    security policy are not intrusive to the user and are designed not to degrade
    user efficiency.

    Security policy enforcement mechanisms also provide the user with meaningful,
    clear, and

    relevant feedback and warnings when insecure choices are being made. Particular
    attention

    is given to interfaces through which personnel responsible for system administration
    and

    operation configure and set up the security policies. Ideally, these personnel
    are able to

    understand the impact of their choices. The personnel with system administrative
    and

    operation responsibility are able to configure systems before start-up and administer
    them

    during runtime, in both cases with confidence that their intent is correctly mapped
    to the

    system’s mechanisms. Security services, functions, and mechanisms do not impede
    or

    unnecessarily complicate the intended use of the system. There is a trade-off
    between

    system usability and the strictness necessitated for security policy enforcement.
    If security

    mechanisms are frustrating or difficult to use, then users may disable or avoid
    them, or use

    the mechanisms in ways inconsistent with the security requirements and protection
    needs

    the mechanisms were designed to satisfy.

    Implement the security design principle of procedural rigor in <1>.
  discussion: >
    The principle of procedural rigor states that the rigor of a system life cycle

    process is commensurate with its intended trustworthiness. Procedural rigor defines
    the

    scope, depth, and detail of the system life cycle procedures. Rigorous system
    life cycle

    procedures contribute to the assurance that the system is correct and free of
    unintended

    functionality in several ways. First, the procedures impose checks and balances
    on the life

    cycle process such that the introduction of unspecified functionality is prevented.

    Second, rigorous procedures applied to systems security engineering activities
    that produce

    specifications and other system design documents contribute to the ability to
    understand

    the system as it has been built, rather than trusting that the component as implemented,
    is

    the authoritative (and potentially misleading) specification.

    Finally, modifications to an existing system component are easier when there are
    detailed

    specifications describing its current design, instead of studying source code
    or schematics to

    try to understand how it works. Procedural rigor helps to ensure that security
    functional and

    assurance requirements have been satisfied, and it contributes to a better-informed
    basis

    for the determination of trustworthiness and risk posture. Procedural rigor is
    commensurate

    with the degree of assurance desired for the system. If the required trustworthiness
    of the

    system is low, a high level of procedural rigor may add unnecessary cost, whereas
    when high

    trustworthiness is critical, the cost of high procedural rigor is merited.

    and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use

    privacy

    policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security
    properties of

    systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection
    of system

    components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes, including

    upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware, may adversely
    affect

    previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows
    for additional

    types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate

    code

    review; security architecture review; penetration testing; and static analysis,
    dynamic analysis,

    binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.

    Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation

    and includes checking for weaknesses in the code and checking for incorporation
    of libraries

    or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and
    not supported.

    Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and to enforce secure
    coding

    practices and Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the development

    process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses.

    Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects
    to enable

    developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis
    include

    aggregate defect density for critical defect types; evidence that defects were
    inspected by

    developers or security professionals; and evidence that defects were remediated.
    A high

    density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates

  discussion: >
    The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design is as simple

    and small as possible (see SA-8(7)). A small and simple design is easier to understand
    and

    analyze, and is also less prone to error (see AC-25, SA-8(13)). The principle
    of reduced

    complexity applies to any aspect of a system, but it has particular importance
    for security

    due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security

    property of the system. For such analyses to be successful, a small and simple
    design is

    essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the
    ability of

    system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security

    functions and facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The
    corollary of

    reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related
    to the number

    of vulnerabilities it will contain—that is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities.
    An

    important benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether
    the

    security policy has been captured in the system design, and that fewer vulnerabilities
    are

    likely to be introduced during engineering development. An additional benefit
    is that any

    such conclusion about correctness, completeness, and existence of vulnerabilities
    can be

    reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in
    situations

    where the system design is inherently more complex.

    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to structure
    security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate controlling access with
    least privilege.
  discussion: >
    The principle of least privilege states that each component is allocated sufficient

    privileges to accomplish its specified functions, but no more (see SA-8(14)).
    Applying the

    principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which
    has two

    desirable effects. First, the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse
    of the system

    component results in a minimized security impact. Second, the security analysis
    of the

    component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected
    in all aspects

    of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are
    available to

    only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently

    fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit
    mechanism,

    there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings;
    an

    interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected
    and stored;

    and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who has need only
    to view the

    audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.

    In addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can
    be used as a

    guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect
    of internal least

    privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the
    module are

    directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to
    a module

    that may be affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through
    interaction

    (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another
    aspect of

    internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes
    only those

    system elements that are necessary for its functionality, and that the access
    modes to the

    elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal.

    Design diversity is achieved by supplying the same requirements specification

    system component that meets the requirements. Variants can be in software design,
    in

    hardware design, or in both hardware and a software design. Differences in the
    designs of

    the variants can result from developer experience (e.g., prior use of a design
    pattern), design

    style (e.g., when decomposing a required function into smaller tasks, determining
    what

    constitutes a separate task, and determining how far to decompose tasks into sub-tasks),

    selection of libraries to incorporate into the variant, and the development environment
    (e.g.,

    different design tools make some design patterns easier to visualize). Hardware
    design

    diversity includes making different decisions about what information to keep in
    analog form

    and what to convert to digital form; transmitting the same information at different

  text: Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.
  discussion: >
    Security functions are isolated from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation

    boundary implemented via partitions and domains. The isolation boundary controls
    access to

    and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform
    those security

    functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, for example, through
    the provision

    of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code,
    security function

    isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code
    on disk and

    address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access
    to security

    functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege
    capabilities.

    While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation
    boundary to only

    contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity
    functions within

    the isolation boundary as an exception. The isolation of security functions from
    nonsecurity

    functions can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design
    principles in SA-8

    including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and

    Minimize the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation boundary
    containing security functions.
  discussion: >
    Where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of nonsecurity functions
    from

    security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize nonsecurity-relevant
    functions

    within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained within
    the isolation

    boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or malicious code in
    the software,

    can directly impact the security functions of systems. The fundamental design
    objective is

    that the specific portions of systems providing information security are of minimal
    size and

    complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant
    system

    components allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions
    which are

    necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement).
    By

    minimizing the nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount
    of code

    that is trusted to enforce security policies is significantly reduced, thus contributing
    to

    understandability.

    components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection
    for selected

    system components. Isolating system components with boundary protection mechanisms

    provides the capability for increased protection of individual system components
    and to

    more effectively control information flows between those components. Isolating
    system

    components provides enhanced protection that limits the potential harm from hostile
    cyber-

    attacks and errors. The degree of isolation varies depending upon the mechanisms
    chosen.

    Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls separating
    system

    components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; virtualization techniques;

    cross-domain devices separating subnetworks; and encrypting information flows
    among

    system components using distinct encryption keys.

    Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can

    security policies. These mechanisms can be activated only by users or the security
    functions of

    organizational systems. User responses via trusted paths are protected from modifications
    by or

    disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for trustworthy,
    high-

    assurance connections between security functions of systems and users, including
    during system

    logons. The original implementations of trusted path employed an out-of-band signal
    to initiate

    the path, for example using the <BREAK> key, which does not transmit characters
    that can be

    spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could not be hijacked

    by identifying,

    controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically
    relates to the

    controls are

    applied to organizational systems and the environments in which those systems

    controls protect the confidentiality of information, including limiting the sharing
    of information

    with suppliers and potential suppliers of system components and services, and

    Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by

    or

    b.   Isolate the OT, IoT, and IIoT systems, components, or devices from the designated

    organizational systems or prohibit network connectivity by the systems, components,
    or

    devices.

    Discussion: Operational Technology (OT) is the hardware, software, and firmware
    components

    of a system used to detect or cause changes in physical processes through the
    direct control and

    monitoring of physical devices. Examples include distributed control systems (DCS),
    supervisory

    control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and programmable logic controllers
    (PLC). The

    term operational technology is used to demonstrate the differences between industrial
    control

    systems (ICS) that are typically found in manufacturing and power plants and the
    information

    technology (IT) systems that typically support traditional data processing applications.
    The term

    Internet of Things (IoT) is used to describe the network of devices (e.g., vehicles,
    medical devices,

    wearables, and home appliances) that contain the hardware, software, firmware,
    and actuators

    which allow the devices to connect, interact, and exchange data and information.
    IoT extends

    Internet connectivity beyond workstations, notebook computers, smartphones and
    tablets to

    physical devices that do not typically have such connectivity. IoT devices can
    communicate and

    interact over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled.
    Finally, the term

    Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is used to describe the sensors, instruments,
    machines, and

    other devices that are networked together and use Internet connectivity to enhance
    industrial

    and manufacturing business processes and applications.

    The recent convergence of IT and OT, producing cyber-physical systems, increases
    the attack

    surface of organizations significantly and provides attack vectors that are challenging
    to address.

    Unfortunately, most of the current generation of IoT, OT and IIOT devices are
    not designed with

    security as a foundational property. Connections to and from such devices are
    generally not

    encrypted, do not provide the necessary authentication, are not monitored, and
    are not logged.

    As a result, these devices pose a significant cyber threat. In some instances,
    gaps in IoT, OT, and

    IIoT security capabilities may be addressed by employing intermediary devices
    that can provide

    encryption, authentication, security scanning, and logging capabilities, and preclude
    the devices

    from being accessible from the Internet. But such mitigating options are not always
    available.

    The situation is further complicated because some of the IoT/OT/IIoT devices are
    needed for

    essential missions and functions. In those instances, it is necessary that such
    devices are isolated

    from the Internet to reduce the susceptibility to hostile cyber-attacks.

    on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
    level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for system-specific policies and
    procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can
    be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures
    can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures
    describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
    role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Restating controls does not constitute an
    organizational policy or procedure.

  discussion: >
    The need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and firmware.

    Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential
    vulnerabilities

    resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational
    personnel

    with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
    include patches,

    service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws
    discovered during

    assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error
    handling. By

    incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required
    remediation

    actions can be tracked and verified.

    Organization-defined time-periods for updating security-relevant software and
    firmware may

    vary based on a variety of risk factors, including the security category of the
    system or the

    criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the
    discovered flaw); the

    organizational mission; or the threat environment. Some types of flaw remediation
    may require

    more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type of testing needed
    for the

    specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of
    changes that are

    to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that
    the testing

    of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when
    implementing

    simple malicious code signature updates. Organizations consider in testing decisions
    whether

  discussion: >
    System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote-access servers, workstations,

    electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook computers, and mobile
    devices.

    Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious
    code can also be

    encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden
    in files using

    techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems
    in a variety of

    ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices.
    Malicious

    code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety
    of technologies

    and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.

    Malicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based

    technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence

    techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics
    or behavior of

    malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures
    do not yet exist or

    for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active
    signatures do

    yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code
    that changes

    signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based

    technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,

    comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may
    be effective in

    preventing execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial
    off-

    the-shelf software and in custom-built software and could include logic bombs,
    back doors, and

    other types of attacks that could affect organizational missions and business
    functions.

    In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or
    technologies,

    organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices,
    configuration

    management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices
    to ensure

    that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations
    may

    determine in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may
    be warranted.

    For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection
    during

    periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, or actions
    in response to

    detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

  discussion: >
    System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring

    includes the observation of events occurring at system boundaries. Internal monitoring
    includes

    the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems,
    for

    example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system
    aspects such as

    access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring
    objectives guide and

    inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved
    through a

    variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention
    systems, malicious

    code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and
    network

    monitoring software.

    Depending on the security architecture implementation, the distribution and configuration
    of

    monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries,
    and at other

    locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency.
    If throughput

    management is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part
    of an

    established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring
    devices

    include selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms supporting
    critical

    applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces
    associated

    with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational

    monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives.
    Specific types of

    transactions of interest include Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that
    bypasses HTTP

    proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring
    and

    incident response programs and output from system monitoring serves as input to
    those

    programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types
    of system

    monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a),
    AC-17(1), AU-

    13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b),
    SC-18c, SC-

    43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement
    information,

    intelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of system
    monitoring

    activities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
    policies,

    standards, and guidelines.

    This control enhancement employs runtime instrumentation to detect and

    from

    the software in execution. Runtime exploit prevention differs from traditional
    perimeter-

    based protections such as guards and firewalls, that can only detect and block
    attacks by

    using network information without contextual awareness. Runtime application self-

    protection technology can reduce the susceptibility of software to attacks by
    monitoring its

    inputs, and blocking those inputs that could allow attacks. It can also help protect
    the

    runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. When a threat is detected,

    runtime application self-protection technology can prevent exploitation and take
    other

    actions (e.g., sending a warning message to the user, terminating the user's session,

    terminating the application, or sending an alert to organizational personnel).
    Runtime

    application self-protection solutions can be deployed in either a monitor or protection

  discussion: >
    Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs, including character

    length, numerical range, and acceptable values, verifies that inputs match specified
    definitions

    for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical
    values between

    1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs
    of 387, abc, or %K%

    are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are
    likely to vary from

    field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined
    protocols

    that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between
    software

    modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured
    data

    interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use
    attacker-supplied

    inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages,
    then the

    attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause
    the data to be

    interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component
    that

    receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
    the data

    incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the
    content from being

    unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and

    wireless

    network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP)

    packet losses

    are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped
    due to noise

    or collisions on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes the wrong
    action in

    Implement non-persistent <1> that are initiated in a known state and terminated <3>.
  discussion: >
    This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by significantly

    reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity
    and available attack

    surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence
    for

    selected system components, organizations can provide a known state computing
    resource for a

    specific time-period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit
    vulnerabilities in

    organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since
    the APT is a

    high-end, sophisticated threat regarding capability, intent, and targeting, organizations
    assume

    that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent
    system

    components and services are activated as required using protected information
    and terminated

    periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor
    of adversaries in

    attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.

    Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components by periodically
    re-imaging

    components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent
    services

    can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines
    or as new

    instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).
    The benefit of

    periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require
    organizations to

    first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something
    that

    may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components
    and services

    occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks,
    but not

    with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components
    and

    services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit
    optimum

    windows of vulnerabilities.

    information

    throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the
    creation, collection,

    identifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations
    include editing

  discussion: >
    De-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association

    between a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain
    information about

    individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity,
    such as name, social

    security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records.
    Datasets

    may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual,
    such as medical,

    educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information
    is

    removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or
    no longer)

    necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if
    the dataset is only

    used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for
    producing those

    statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection, since
    information that

    is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations
    may be subject

    to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations,
    or policies.

    Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification
    attacks can vary

    including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining

    awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification
    over

    time supports management of this residual risk.

    There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers from a

    In masking,

    the direct identifier is transformed into a repeating character, for example,
    XXXXXX or

    999999. Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed, so that the linked records remain
    linked. In

    the case of encryption or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use
    of a key,

    including the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication
    Code.

    Implementations may use the same key for all identifiers or use a different key
    for each

    identifier. Using a different key for each identifier provides for a higher degree
    of security

    and privacy. Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including
    transforming

    “George Washington” to “PATIENT,” or replaced with a surrogate value, for example,

    transforming “George Washington” to “Abraham Polk.”

    Embed data or capabilities in the following systems or system components to

    Discussion: Many cyber-attacks target organizational information (or sensitive
    information the

    organization holds on behalf of other entities (e.g., personally identifiable
    information) and

    exfiltrate that data. In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures
    can remove

    information from the system in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting
    approaches can

    range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as
    adding false email

    names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives email
    at one of the

    false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised. Moreover,
    the

    organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity so any packets
    it includes

    potentially contain malicious code and that the unauthorized entity potentially
    has obtained a

    copy of the database. A less passive tainting approach can include embedding false
    data or

    steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found via open source analysis.
    And finally,

    an active tainting approach can include embedding software in the data that is
    able to “call

    home” alerting the organization to its “capture” and possibly its location and
    the path by which it

    was exfiltrated or removed.

    the lost information. Therefore, organizations may consider taking the information

    detection. The

    fragmentation of information also impacts the organization’s ability to access
    the information in

    a timely manner. The extent of the fragmentation would likely be dictated by the
    sensitivity (and

    value) of the information, threat intelligence information received, and if data

    The growing dependence on products, systems, and services from external

    providers, along with the nature of the relationships with those providers, present
    an increasing

    level of risk to an organization. Specific threat actions that may increase risk
    include the insertion

    or use of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of
    malicious software

    and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply
    chain that

    can create security or privacy risks. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic
    within a

    system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation.
    Managing

    supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated
    effort across an

    organization building trust relationships and communicating with both internal
    and external

    stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities involve identifying
    and assessing

    risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing SCRM plans to document
    selected

    mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against plans.

    Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations,
    SCRM plans are

    tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.
    Tailored SCRM plans

    provide the basis for determining whether a system is fit for purpose; and as
    such, the controls

    need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations to focus
    their resources

    on the most critical missions and business functions based on mission and business
    requirements

    and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression
    of the

    supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk
    mitigation strategies

    or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain
    risk, approaches

    for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification
    for supply chain

    risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally,
    supply chain risk

    management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy secure, privacy-protective,

    and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the
    security design

    principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering
    processes (see

  discussion: >
    Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to

    gaining visibility into supply chain activities. Visibility into supply chain
    activities is also

    important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without
    reasonable

    visibility into supply chains elements, processes, and personnel, it is very difficult
    for

    organizations to understand and manage risk, and ultimately reduce the susceptibility
    to

    adverse events. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools
    used for the

    development, acquisition, delivery, maintenance and disposal of systems and system

    components. Supply chain processes include development processes for hardware,

    software, and firmware; shipping and handling procedures; configuration management

    tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; personnel and physical
    security

    programs; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production

    distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain personnel are individuals
    with specific

    roles and responsibilities related to the secure development, delivery, maintenance,
    and

    disposal of a system or system component. Identification methods are sufficient

    establishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, system components may be
    labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. Labels and
    tags can help provide better visibility into the provenance of a system or system component.
    A system or system component may have more than one unique identifier. Identification

    For many systems and system components, especially hardware, there are

    technical means to determine if the items are genuine or have been altered, including

    optical and nanotechnology tagging; physically unclonable functions; side-channel
    analysis;

    cryptographic hash verifications or digital signatures; and visible anti-tamper
    labels or

    stickers. Controls can also include monitoring for out of specification performance,
    which

    can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier
    and

    contractor processes for validating that a system or component is genuine and
    has not been

    altered, and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of
    tampering

    may be visible and addressable before accepting delivery, including inconsistent
    packaging,

    broken seals, and incorrect labels. When a system or system component is suspected
    of

    being altered or counterfeit, the supplier, contractor, or original equipment
    manufacturer

    may be able to replace the item or provide a forensic capability to determine
    the origin of

    the counterfeit or altered item. Organizations can provide training to personnel

    The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the

    supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including
    obscuring the end

    use of a system or system component; using blind or filtered buys; requiring tamper-evident

    packaging; or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply
    chain risk

    assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most
    applicable to

    the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized
    production,

    theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or
    backdoors, and

    poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations
    also

    consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls; promote transparency
    into

    their processes and security and privacy practices; provide contract language
    that addresses the

    prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components; and restrict purchases from
    untrustworthy

    suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness
    programs for
