    a.   Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
         roles]:
         1.    An access control policy that:
               (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
                   coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
               (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies,
                   standards, and guidelines; and
         2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated
               access controls;
    b.   Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined senior management official] to manage the
         access control policy and procedures;
    c.   Review and update the current access control:
         1.    Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
         2.    Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
    d.   Ensure that the access control procedures implement the access control policy and controls;
         and
    e.   Develop, document, and implement remediation actions for violations of the access control
         policy.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

    effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the AC family.
    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize
    that restating

    controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

    a.   Define and document the types of system accounts allowed for use within the system in
         support of organizational missions and business functions;




    b.   Assign account managers for system accounts;
    c.   Establish conditions for group and role membership;
    d.   Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access authorizations
         (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
    e.   Require approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to
         create system accounts;
    f.   Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove system accounts in accordance with [Assignment:
         organization-defined policy, procedures, and conditions];
    g.   Monitor the use of system accounts;
    h.   Notify account managers within [Assignment: organization-defined time-period for each
         situation]:
         1.   When accounts are no longer required;
         2.   When users are terminated or transferred; and
         3.   When individual system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual;
    i.   Authorize access to the system based on:
         1.   A valid access authorization;
         2.   Intended system usage; and
         3.   Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions and business
              functions;
    j.   Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:
         organization-defined frequency];
    k.   Establish a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when
         individuals are removed from the group; and
    l.   Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    System account types include, for example, individual, shared, group,

    system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary,
    and service.

    The identification of authorized users of the system and the specification of
    access privileges

    reflects the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring
    administrative

    privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational
    personnel

    responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including, for
    example, system

    owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer. Organizations
    may choose to

    define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or
    a combination of

    both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions
    on time-of-

    day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations
    consider

    system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider
    these factors

    could affect system availability.

    Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations
    establish

    temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there
    is a need for

    short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations

    establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need
    for rapid account

    activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
    authorization

    processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently
    used

    accounts including, for example, local logon accounts used for special tasks or
    when network

    resources are unavailable. Such accounts remain available and are not subject
    to automatic

    disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts
    include, for example,






    when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or
    when individuals

    are transferred or terminated. Some types of system accounts may require specialized
    training.

AC-2(1):
  text: Employ automated mechanisms to support the management of system accounts.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example, using
    email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated
    or transferred; using the system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic notification to
    report atypical system account usage.
AC-2(2):
  text: |
    Automatically [Selection: remove; disable] temporary and emergency accounts after [Assignment:
    organization-defined time-period for each type of account].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement requires the removal or disabling of both
    temporary and emergency accounts automatically after a predefined time-period has elapsed,
    rather than at the convenience of the systems administrator. Automatic removal or disabling
    of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.
AC-2(3):
  text: |
    Automatically disable accounts when the accounts:
    (a)   Have expired;
    (b) Are no longer associated to a user;
    (c)   Are in violation of organizational policy;
    (d) Are no longer used by applications, services, or the system; and
    (e)   Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time-period].
  supplemental-guidance: None.
AC-2(4):

    Automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and
    notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
  supplemental-guidance: None.
AC-2(5):
  text: |
    Require that users log out when [Assignment: organization-defined time-period of expected
    inactivity or description of when to log out].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement is behavior/policy-based and requires users
    to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined
    period.
AC-2(6):
  text: |
    Implement the following dynamic privilege management capabilities: [Assignment: organization-
    defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
    static system accounts and predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely
    on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management such as
    attribute based access control (ABAC). While user identities remain relatively constant over
    time, user privileges typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business
    requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can



    include, for example, immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring
    that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic
    privilege management can also include those mechanisms that change user privileges based
    on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic
    adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, their job
    function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations.
    This control enhancement also includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, the
    changes to encryption keys used for communications.
AC-2(7):
  text: |
    (a)   Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
          scheme that organizes allowed system access and privileges into roles;
    (b) Monitor privileged role assignments; and
    (c)   Revoke access when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
    that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users
    are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management,
    account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web
    administration.
AC-2(8):
  text: |
    Create, activate, manage, and deactivate [Assignment: organization-defined system accounts]
    dynamically.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and
    deactivating system or service/application accounts rely on automatically provisioning the
    accounts at run time for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for the
    dynamic creation, activation, management, and deactivation of these accounts by establishing
    trust relationships, business rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
    related authorizations and privileges.
AC-2(9):
  text: |
    Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [Assignment: organization-defined
    conditions for establishing shared and group accounts].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations
    consider the increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts.
AC-2(10):
  text: Change shared and group account credentials when members leave the group.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement is intended to ensure that former group
    members do not retain access to the shared/group account.
AC-2(11):
  text: |
    Enforce [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage conditions] for
    [Assignment: organization-defined system accounts].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement helps to enforce the principle of least
    privilege, increase user accountability, and enable more effective account monitoring. Such
    monitoring includes, for example, alerts generated if the account is used outside of specified
    parameters. Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances under which
    system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to certain days of the week,
    time of day, or specific durations of time.
AC-2(12):
  text: |
    (a)   Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage]; and
    (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
        roles].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing systems at certain
    times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of
    individuals working in organizations. Account monitoring may inadvertently create privacy
    risks. Data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal previously unknown information
    about the behavior of individuals. Organizations assess and document these risks in their
    privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy
    program plan.
AC-2(13):
  text: |
    Disable accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment: organization-defined time-
    period] of discovery of the risk.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for
    whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access
    to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Such harm includes
    the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
    organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination and cooperation among authorizing officials,
    system administrators, and human resource managers is essential for timely execution of this
    control enhancement.
AC-2(14):

    Prohibit the creation and use of [Selection (one or more): shared; guest; anonymous; temporary;
    emergency] accounts for access to [Assignment: organization-defined information types].

    (a)   Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with an attribute-based
          access scheme that specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes;
    (b) Monitor privileged attribute-based assignments;
    (c)   Monitor changes to attributes; and
    (d) Revoke access when privileged attribute-based assignments are no longer appropriate.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
    that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users
    are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management,
    account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web
    administration.
AC-3:
  text: accordance with applicable access control policies.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects
    (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices,
    files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the
    system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of
    organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be
    employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.

    Enforce [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policy] over defined
    subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to
    information can do one or more of the following:
    (a)   Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;
    (b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;
    (c)   Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the system, or the system’s components;
    (d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or
    (e)   Change the rules governing access control.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects

    are not constrained regarding what actions they can take with information for
    which they have

    already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information
    are

    not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the
    information to

    other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction
    with AC-3(3).

    A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3(3)
    is still able to

    operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Therefore,
    while AC-

    3(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another
    subject

    operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass
    the information

    to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the system
    boundary.

    Once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional
    means may be

    required to help ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the older,
    more traditional

    definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control,
    that limitation

    is not required for this use of discretionary access control.
AC-3(5):
  text: |
    Prevent access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information] except during
    secure, non-operable system states.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Security-relevant information is any information within systems that

    can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of
    security services

    in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or
    maintain the

    isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example,
    filtering rules

    for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration
    parameters

    for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states
    include the

    times in which systems are not performing mission/business-related processing,
    for example,

    the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, or shut down.
AC-3(7):
  text: |
    Enforce a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control access
    based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users authorized to assume such roles].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that
    restricts system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles based on
    job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the
    systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the
    organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles.
    RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not
    assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to
    large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be
    implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations




    implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the
    scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.
AC-3(8):
  text: |
    Enforce the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes to the security attributes
    of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules governing the timing of
    revocations of access authorizations].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access

    revoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group,
    access may

    not be revoked until the next time the object is opened or the next time the subject
    attempts a

    new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels may take
    effect

    immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations

    immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation is
    necessary.
AC-3(9):
  text: |
    Release information outside of the established system boundary only if:
    (a)   The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined system or system component] provides
          [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and
    (b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the
        appropriateness of the information designated for release.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Systems can only protect organizational information within the

    confines of established system boundaries. Additional security controls may be
    needed to

    ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond
    the established

    system boundaries. In situations where the system is unable to determine the adequacy
    of the

    protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control,
    organizations

    determine procedurally whether the external systems are providing adequate security.
    The

    means used to determine the adequacy of security provided by external systems
    include, for

    example, conducting inspections or periodic testing and assessments; establishing
    agreements

    between the organization and its counterpart organizations; or some other process.
    The means

    used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the
    same as those

    used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent

    adjudication of the security policy to protect the information.

    This control enhancement requires systems to employ technical or procedural means
    to

    validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example,
    if the system

    passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical
    means are

    employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported
    information are

    appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the system passes information
    to a

    printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to
    ensure that

    only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control
    enhancement

    is most applicable when there is some policy mandate that establishes policy regarding
    access

    to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm of a particular system
    or

    organization.
AC-3(10):
  text: |
    Employ an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under [Assignment:
    organization-defined conditions] by [Assignment: organization-defined roles].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    In certain situations, for example, where there is a threat to human life
    or an event that threatens the organization’s ability carry out critical missions or business
    functions, an override capability for access control mechanisms may be needed. Such override
    conditions are defined by organizations and are used only in those limited circumstances.
AC-3(11):
  text: |
    Restrict direct access to data repositories containing [Assignment: organization-defined
    information types].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement is intended to provide flexibility regarding
    access control of specific pieces of information within a system. For example, role-based
    access could be employed to allow access to only a specific type of personally identifiable
    information within a database rather than allowing access to the database in its entirety.
AC-3(12):
  text: |
    (a)   Require applications to assert, as part of the installation process, the access needed to the
          following system applications and functions: [Assignment: organization-defined system
          applications and functions]; and
    (b) Provide an enforcement mechanism to prevent other-than-asserted access.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement is intended to address applications that need
    to access existing system applications and functions including, for example, user contacts;
    global positioning system; camera; keyboard; microphone; network; or phones or other files.
AC-3(13):
  text: |
    Enforce attribute-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control
    access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined attributes to assume access permissions].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control policy that

    restricts system access to authorized users based on their organizational attributes,
    such as job

    function; environmental attributes, such as time of day; and resource attributes,
    such as the

    classification of a document. Organizations can create specific rules based on
    attributes and

    the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems
    associated

    with the organization-defined attributes and rules. When users are assigned to
    attributes

    defined in ABAC policies or rules, they can be provisioned to a system with appropriate

    privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource upon access.
    ABAC can be

    implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For
    organizations

    implementing ABAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3)
    define the

    scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.
AC-4:

    Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system
    and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow
    control policies].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a

    system and between systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information)
    and without

    explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions
    include, for

    example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear
    to the Internet,

    blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting
    web requests to

    the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
    transfers

    between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information
    between

    systems in different security domains with different security policies introduces
    risk that such

    transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information
    owners or

    stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected

    systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when
    required to

    enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example, prohibiting
    information

    transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing
    hardware





    mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy
    regrading

    mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

    Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement
    mechanisms

    to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations
    within systems and

    between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of
    the information

    and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection
    devices that

    employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services,
    provide a packet-

    filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability
    based on message

    content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection
    mechanisms (i.e.,

    hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information
    flow enforcement.

    Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs
    which focus on

    more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement
    mechanisms

    implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such
    capabilities are

    generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

    Use [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated with [Assignment:
    organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce [Assignment:
    organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes

    associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination
    objects,

    and respond appropriately when the mechanisms encounter information flows not
    explicitly

    allowed by information flow policies. For example, an information object labeled
    Secret

    would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled Secret, but an information
    object

    labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled
    Secret.

    Security attributes can also include, for example, source and destination addresses
    employed

    in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit security attributes
    can be used, for

    example, to control the release of certain types of information.

    Within systems, protected processing domains are processing spaces
    that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, enabling control of information
    flows between these spaces and to/from data/information objects. A protected processing
    domain can be provided, for example, by implementing domain and type enforcement. In
    domain and type enforcement, system processes are assigned to domains; information is
    identified by types; and information flows are controlled based on allowed information
    accesses (determined by domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed
    process transitions to other domains.

    data).

    Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words enumerated
    values or data

    value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation of
    data content by

    applications. Unstructured data refers to digital information without a data structure
    or with a

    data structure that does not facilitate the development of rule sets to address
    the sensitivity of

    the information conveyed by the data or the flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured
    data

    consists of bitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based (i.e., image,
    video, or audio

    files); and textual objects that are based on written or printed languages. Organizations

    different individuals and/or roles; conducting system support functions with different
    individuals;

    and ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not
    also administer

    This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within
    privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations
    implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of

  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no
    identification or authentication is required in organizational systems. Organizations may allow a
    limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for example,
    when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when
    individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also




    identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain
    circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses
    may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the
    logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not
    apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not
    repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred.
    Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational
    systems without identification and authentication and therefore, the values for assignment
    statements can be none.

    Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions

    known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types
    of entities, both

    active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated
    with

    individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities,
    also known as

    objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers,
    tables, files, inter-

    process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata,
    are abstractions

    representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities
    with respect to

    safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently,
    or in conjunction

    with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of
    an entity with respect to

    the management of personally identifiable information. Such attributes are used
    to enable the

    implementation of the need for the record in the performance of duties, the identification
    of

    personal information within data objects, and the identification of permitted
    uses of personal

    information. Attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the information
    contained in

    organizational systems or system components.

    Security and privacy attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e.,
    subjects) that have the

    potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects,
    or to change

    the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities
    (i.e., objects) that

    contain or receive information. The association of security and privacy attributes
    to subjects and

    objects is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value
    and the attribute type.

    Security and privacy attributes when bound to data or information, enable the
    enforcement of

    security policies for access control and information flow control and privacy
    policies including,




    for example, for data retention limits and permitted uses of personally identifiable
    information.

    Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or
    mechanisms.

    Binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding
    to information.

    Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play an
    important part in

    the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The
    binding techniques

    affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations.
    The content or

    assigned values of the security and privacy attributes can directly affect the
    ability of individuals

    to access organizational information.

    Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected systems to
    support missions or

    business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned
    to any given

    security attribute. Release markings can include, for example, US only, NATO,
    or NOFORN (not

    releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and
    values, organizations

    ensure that the security and privacy attribute values are meaningful and relevant.
    Labeling refers

    to the association of security and privacy attributes with subjects and objects
    represented by the

    internal data structures within organizational systems. This facilitates system-based
    enforcement

    of information security and privacy policies. Labels include, for example, access
    authorizations,

    nationality, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),
    data subject consents,

    permissible data uses, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information
    in accordance

    with legal and compliance requirements. Conversely, marking refers to the association
    of security

    and privacy attributes with objects in a human-readable form. This enables manual,
    procedural, or

    process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Examples
    of attribute

    types include classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization)
    level for subjects.

    An attribute value for both attribute types is Top Secret.

    The association (i.e., binding) of security and privacy attributes to
    information within systems is important for conducting automated access enforcement and
    flow enforcement actions. The association of such attributes can be accomplished with
    technologies and techniques providing different levels of assurance. For example, systems can

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on

    behalf of users) communicating through external networks such as the Internet.
    Remote access

    methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations
    often employ

    encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity
    over remote

    connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization
    that it

    can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic
    mechanisms used

    are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
    regulations,

    policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external
    networks, and the

    encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with
    encrypted

    tunnels can also affect the capability to adequately monitor network communications

    c.    Protect and control mobile devices when outside of controlled areas.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such

    that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without
    a physical

    connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes
    a self-

    contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication

    capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or
    built-in features

    for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones,
    E-readers, and

    tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and
    the device is usually

    near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon
    on the form factor

    and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of
    the mobile device

    may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending
    upon the nature

    and intended purpose of the device. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which
    organizations

    provide sufficient physical or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements
    established for

    protecting information and systems.

    Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and
    capabilities,

    organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices.
    Usage

    restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include,
    for example,

    configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation
    of mandatory

    protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
    software,

    scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating
    system (and

    possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary
    hardware.

    Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational
    systems. For

    example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the
    organizational

    network and impose a set of usage restrictions while a system owner may withhold
    authorization

    for mobile device connection to specific applications or may impose additional
    usage restrictions

    before allowing mobile device connections to a system. The need to provide adequate
    security for

    mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards for
    mobile devices

    are reflected in other security controls allocated to the initial control baselines
    as starting points for

    b.    Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    External systems are systems or components of systems that are outside of

    the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations
    typically

    have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security
    controls or the

    assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include, for example, personally
    owned

    systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications
    devices in

    commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;
    and

    federal systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision
    and authority

    of the organization. This includes systems managed by contractors, systems owned
    by other

    federal agencies, and systems owned by other organizations within the same agency.
    This control

    addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission
    of organizational

    information, including, for example, accessing cloud services from organizational
    systems.

    For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other federal agencies and
    organizations

    subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established
    between those

    organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms
    and conditions

    are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external.
    These situations

    occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing and trust agreements (either
    implicit or

    explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to
    those agencies, or

    when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
    directives,

    regulations, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational
    personnel,

    contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems
    and over which

    organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior with regard
    to system access.

    Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform,
    as those

    restrictions may vary depending on the trust relationships between organizations.
    Therefore,

    organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors
    than on state,

    local, or tribal governments.

    This control does not apply to external systems used to access public interfaces
    to organizational

    systems. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of
    external systems in

    accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions
    address as

    a minimum: the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational
    systems from





    external systems; and the highest security category of information that can be
    processed, stored, or

    transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of
    external systems

    cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational
    personnel using

    those external systems.

    Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and

    database fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for
    example, limiting

    the types of responses provided to database queries; limiting the number and the
    frequency of

    database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents
    of such databases;

    and notifying organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses

    Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur

    when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access
    enforcement

    occurs when systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common
    to have access

    control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is
    not required and it

    is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed
    systems,

    different entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    In distributed systems, authorization processes and access control

    decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization

    information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be
    enforced at the

    appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary
    to transmit

    as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes.
    This is because

    in distributed systems, there are various access control decisions that need to
    be made and

    different entities make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring security
    attributes to

    make the decisions. Protecting access authorization information ensures that such
    information

    cannot be altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.

    In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be

    made without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests.
    These are

    generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance.
    In other

    situations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control
    decisions

    and, especially in the case of distributed systems, transmitting such information
    with the

    needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.

    Implement a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined access control
    policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and
    testing, the completeness of which can be assured.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions

    known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types
    of entities, both

    active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with
    individuals,

    devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also
    known as objects, are

    typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files,
    inter-process pipes,

    and communications ports. Reference monitors enforce mandatory access control
    policies, a type

    of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects
    or groups to

    which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because subjects
    with certain

    privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those privileges
    on to any other

    subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the system strictly enforces
    the access control policy

    based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property of the
    reference monitor

    prevents adversaries from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always
    invoked

    property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating
    the security

    policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the completeness in the analysis
    and testing of the

    mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would
    prevent the

    enforcement of the security policy.

    A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard

    that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations
    against

    malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel
    are

    an

    unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving
    an

    email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or
    contractor.

    Personnel are also trained on how to respond to suspicious email or web communications.
    For

    this process to work effectively, organizational personnel are trained and made
    aware of what

    constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize
    anomalous

    behaviors in organizational systems can potentially provide early warning for

          along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational system.

    Organizations identify audit event types as those events which are significant
    and relevant to the

    security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet
    specific and

    ongoing audit needs. Audit event types can include, for example, password changes;
    failed logons

    or failed accesses related to systems; security attribute changes, administrative
    privilege usage,

    PIV credential usage, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining
    the set of

    auditable event types, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each
    of the security

    controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other system
    needs, this

    control also requires identifying that subset of auditable event types that are
    audited at a given

    point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have
    the capability to

    log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that
    capability except for

    specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.

    Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced
    in other

    security and privacy controls and control enhancements for example, AC-2(4), AC-3(10),
    AC-

    6(9), AC-16(11), AC-17(1), CM-3.f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PA-4.d,

    22, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations
    also include

    auditable event types that are required by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
    directives, policies,

    regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various
    levels, including

    at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate
    level of auditing

    is an important aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification
    of root causes to

    problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable event types, the
    auditing necessary

    to cover related event types such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based
    processes and

    actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.

    functionality to configure audit record content. Detailed information that organizations
    may

    consider in audit records includes, for example, full text recording of privileged

    the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting
    the additional

    audit information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit
    requirements.

    Off-load audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a different system or
    media than the system being audited.
  supplemental-guidance: |2
      Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and
    integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary system to a secondary or
    alternate system. It is a common process in systems with limited audit storage capacity; the
    audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the
    secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at which point the
    information is transferred.

    b.    Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be taken].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organization-defined actions include, for example, shutting down the

    system; overwriting oldest audit records; and stopping the generation of audit
    records. Examples

    of audit processing failures include, for example, software and hardware errors;
    failures in the

    audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
    Organizations

    may choose to define additional actions for audit processing failures based on
    the type of failure,

    the location of the failure, the severity of the failure, or a combination of
    such factors. This control

    applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct system component
    where audit records

    are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit
    data storage repositories

    combined), or both.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of
    network communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage
    capacity of the system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered by the
    established organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on changes
    to audit storage capacity.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger

    automatic system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance of
    ensuring

    mission and business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of
    the audit

    failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the system supporting
    the core

    organizational missions and business operations. In those instances, partial system
    shutdowns

    or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may be viable alternatives.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related

    auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results

    of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection,
    configuration

    settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance,

    physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications

    system boundaries, and use of mobile code or VoIP. Findings can be reported to
    organizational

    entities that include, for example, the incident response team, help desk, information
    security

    group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing
    audit information

    or unable to conduct such activities, the review/analysis may be carried out by
    other organizations

    granted such authority. The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit review,

    information; performance data; system monitoring information; [Assignment: organization-defined
    data/information collected from other sources]] to further enhance the ability to identify
    inappropriate or unusual activity.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the

    generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement
    requires that

    the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated
    with the

    analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System
    tools can

    facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple system components
    as well as

    audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis
    scripts

    developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides
    more

    cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The
    correlation of

    audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important
    in determining

    the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with
    scanning

    results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial of service attacks
    or other types

    of attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system
    monitoring

    information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information
    to

    operational situations.

    The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from

    systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior
    or supporting

    evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s identity
    for logical

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Organizations specify permitted actions for system processes, roles,
    and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through
    account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit information is a way
    to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the system and
    include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.

    This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the
    dedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such
    information on the system where the users have elevated privileges including the capability to
    execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers the full text
    of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to analysis that
    considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for example, the use of
    pattern matching and heuristics.

    SOURCES
    Correlate information from nontechnical sources with audit information to enhance organization-
    wide situational awareness.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records

    documenting organizational policy violations including, for example, sexual harassment

    incidents and improper use of organizational information assets. Such information
    can lead to

    a more directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity.
    Due to the

    sensitive nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations
    limit

    access to such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release
    of privacy-

    related information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation
    of

    information from nontechnical sources with audit information generally occurs
    only when

    individuals are suspected of being involved in a security incident. Organizations
    obtain legal

    advice prior to initiating such actions.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information

    and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to
    analysts. Audit

    reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same
    system or from

    the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction
    capability can

    include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters
    to identify

    anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided
    by the system can

    generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant
    issue if the

    granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.

    Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is

    commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation
    of Greenwich

    Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements

    refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks,
    for example,

    clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.
    Organizations may

    define different time granularities for different system components. Time service
    can also be

    critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification
    and authentication,

    depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

    When organizations use systems and/or services of external organizations,

    the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations.
    For example,

    maintaining the identity of individuals that requested specific services across
    organizational

    boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant
    performance

    and privacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational

    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations assess security and privacy controls in organizational

    systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial
    and ongoing

    authorizations; FISMA annual assessments; continuous monitoring; and system development
    life

    cycle activities. Assessments ensure that organizations meet information security
    and privacy

    requirements; identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the development process;
    provide essential

    information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes;
    and ensure

    compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments
    on the

    implemented controls from Chapter Three as documented in security plans and privacy
    plans.

    Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability
    scanning and

    system monitoring to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during
    the entire life

    cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as
    deemed necessary by

    organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether
    the controls

    are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
    with respect

    to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or
    roles appropriate

    for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted
    in support of

    authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials
    for privacy,

    and/or authorizing official designated representatives.

    To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results
    from the

    following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations; continuous monitoring;
    or system

    development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results
    are current, relevant

    to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate
    level of assessor

    independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent
    that the results are

    still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.
    After the initial

    authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations
    also

    establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational
    continuous

    monitoring strategies. External audits including, for example, audits by external
    entities such as

    regulatory agencies, are outside the scope of this control.

    Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct security and privacy control
    assessments.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups

    conducting impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality implies that assessors
    are free from

    any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding development, operation,
    sustainment, or

    management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness.

    To achieve impartiality, assessors should not create a mutual or conflicting interest
    with the

    organizations where the assessments are being conducted; assess their own work;
    act as

    management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or place themselves
    in

    positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent
    assessments

    can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public
    or private

    sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the
    required level of

    independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational

    operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also
    determine if the

    level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results
    are sound and can

    be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether
    contracted

    assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when system owners
    are not

    directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality
    of assessors

    conducting assessments. When organizations that own the systems are small or organizational

    structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the
    developmental,

    operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment
    processes

    can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and
    analyzed by

    independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity,
    and reliability

    of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes
    other than

    direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with
    sufficient

    independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the
    need to

    repeat assessments.

    are connected to

    other systems with different security and privacy requirements and controls, including
    systems

    within the same organization and systems external to the organization. Authorizing
    officials

    determine the risk associated with system connections and the appropriate controls
    employed. If

    interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not
    need to develop

    Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, those organizations can describe
    the interface

    characteristics between the interconnecting systems in their respective security
    and privacy plans.

    If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same
    organization, the

    organizations can develop Interconnection Security Agreements or they can describe

    respective systems.

    Organizations may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information
    into formal

    contracts, especially for interconnections established between federal agencies
    and nonfederal

    accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
    and the

    Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon security and privacy controls.
    Authorizing

    officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems or assume responsibility
    for the

    mission and business operations supported by those systems. The authorization
    process is a federal

    responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees.
    Authorizing officials

    are responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with
    the operation and

    use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes
    to authorize

    their systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated
    responsibilities.

    Organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of systems by implementing continuous
    monitoring

    programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization

    processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes,
    critical

    information contained in authorization packages including the security and privacy
    plans, security

    and privacy assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones, is updated
    on an ongoing

    basis. This provides authorizing officials, system owners, and common control
    providers with an

    up-to-date status of the security and privacy state of their systems, controls,
    and environments of

    controls and associated risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based
    decisions. The results

    of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions by organizations. When
    monitoring the

    effectiveness of controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause
    analysis may be

    needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring
    programs also

    allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls
    over time in

    highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs,
    threats,




    vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related
    information on a

    continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials
    the capability to

    make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization

    decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and

    Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on

    systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could
    be exploited by

    adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning
    and is most

    effectively conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with demonstrable
    skills and

    experience that, depending on the scope of the penetration testing, include technical
    expertise in

    network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing
    can be used to

    either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance
    of systems to

    adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include, for example,
    time, resources,

    and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries
    in carrying out

    attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-
    and privacy-

    related weaknesses or deficiencies. Organizations can use the results of vulnerability
    analyses to

    support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on
    the hardware,

    software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and
    technical

    controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example, pretest
    analysis based

    on full knowledge of the target system; pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities
    based on

    pretest analysis; and testing designed to determine exploitability of identified
    vulnerabilities. All

    parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencement of penetration testing
    scenarios.

    Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with
    the tools, techniques,

    and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out
    attacks. Risk

    assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required for personnel
    conducting

    penetration testing.
CA-8(1):

    Employ an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on
    the system or system components.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who

    conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational systems. Impartiality
    implies that

    penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of
    interest with

    respect to the development, operation, or management of the systems that are the
    targets of

    the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2(1) provides additional
    information

    on independent assessments that can be applied to penetration testing.

    Employ [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises] to simulate attempts by
    adversaries to compromise organizational systems in accordance with applicable rules of
    engagement.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by
    examining the security and privacy posture of organizations and their ability to implement
    effective cyber defenses. Red team exercises reflect simulated attempts by adversaries to
    compromise organizational missions and business functions and provide a comprehensive
    assessment of the security and privacy state of systems and organizations. Simulated attempts
    by adversaries to compromise missions and business functions and the systems that support
    those missions and functions may include technology-based attacks and social engineering-
    based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions with hardware, software, or
    firmware components and/or mission and business processes. Social engineering-based
    attacks include interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations.
    Red team exercises are most effectively conducted by penetration testing agents and teams
    with knowledge of and experience with current adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures,
    and tools. While penetration testing may be primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations



    can use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world
    conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security and privacy awareness and
    training and to assess control effectiveness.

    for example,

    system connections with mobile devices, notebook computers, desktop computers,
    workstations,

    printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead
    of authorizing each

    individual internal system connection, organizations can authorize internal connections
    for a class

    of system components with common characteristics and/or configurations. This can

  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

    effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the CM family.
    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize
    that restating

    controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control establishes baseline configurations for systems and system

    components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems.
    Baseline

    configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications
    for

    systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve
    as a basis for

    future builds, releases, and/or changes to systems. Baseline configurations include
    information

    about system components, network topology, and the logical placement of those
    components

    within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating
    new

    baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations
    of systems reflect

    the current enterprise architecture.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent

    baseline configurations for systems include, for example, hardware and software
    inventory

    tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Such tools
    can be

    deployed and/or allocated as common controls, at the system level, or at the operating
    system

    or component level including, for example, on workstations, servers, notebook
    computers,

    network components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used, for example, to track
    version

    numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current
    patch

    levels. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-8(2)
    for

    organizations that choose to combine system component inventory and baseline configuration

    activities.

    Maintain a baseline configuration for system development and test environments that is managed
    separately from the operational baseline configuration.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing,
    and operational environments helps protect systems from unplanned/unexpected events
    related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow
    organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of
    configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes




    the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater
    flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational
    environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the
    proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate
    configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments.

        individuals return from travel.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-

    risk areas, additional controls may be implemented to counter the increased threat
    in such

    areas. For example, organizations can take specific actions for notebook computers
    used by

    individuals departing on and returning from travel. These actions can include,
    for example,

    determining which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for
    the devices,

    ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated,
    and applying

    specific safeguards to the component after travel is completed. Specially configured
    notebook

    computers include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited
    applications,

    and more stringent configuration settings. Specified safeguards applied to mobile
    devices

    upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of
    physical

    tampering; and purging and reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information
    residing on

    mobile devices is covered in the media protection family.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Configuration change controls for organizational systems involve the
    systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to
    the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes
    changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of systems; changes to
    configuration settings for component products; unscheduled or unauthorized changes; and changes
    to remediate vulnerabilities. Configuration change control elements can include such entities as
    committees or boards. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to systems include,
    for example, Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve




    proposed changes to systems. For new development systems or systems undergoing major
    upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the
    Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities
    before and after changes are made to organizational systems and the auditing activities required to
    implement such changes.

    ensure that

    testing does not interfere with system operations. Individuals or groups conducting
    tests

    understand organizational security and privacy policies and procedures, system
    security and

    privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety, and environmental risks
    associated

    with specific facilities or processes. Operational systems may need to be taken
    off-line, or

    replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If systems
    must be taken off-

    line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages
    whenever

    possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations
    employ

    compensating controls.

    Information security representatives can include, for example, Senior

    Agency Information Security Officers, system security officers, or system security
    managers.

    Representation by personnel with information security expertise is important because
    changes

    to system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be
    security-

    relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can help avoid unintended,
    negative

    consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of organizational
    systems. The

    configuration change control element in this control enhancement reflects the
    change control

    elements defined by organizations in CM-3.

    Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts prior to
    change implementation.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct

    impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary
    skills and technical

    expertise to analyze the changes to systems and the associated security or privacy
    ramifications.

    Security and privacy impact analyses include, for example, reviewing security
    and privacy plans,

    policies, and procedures to understand security and privacy control requirements;
    reviewing

    system design documentation to understand control implementation and how specific
    changes

    might affect the controls; and determining how potential changes to a system create
    new risks to

    the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate
    those risks. Impact

    analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact
    of the changes and

    to determine if additional security or privacy controls are required.

    Analyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before implementation in an
    operational environment, looking for security and privacy impacts due to flaws, weaknesses,
    incompatibility, or intentional malice.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is

    physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment.
    The separation

    is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact
    activities in the

    operational environment, and information in the operational environment is not
    inadvertently

    transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by
    physical or

    logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used, organizations
    determine

    the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of

    systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the
    systems. Therefore,

    organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems
    for purposes of

    initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions
    for change also

    include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical
    and logical access

    controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers
    (i.e., changes

    implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change
    windows (i.e.,

    changes occur only during specified times).
CM-5(1):

    Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless
    signed with recognized and approved certificates include, for example, software and firmware
    version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input output system (BIOS)
    updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by
    specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of

    d.    Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational
          policies and procedures.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in hardware,

    software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture
    or functionality of

    the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration
    settings can

    be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input/output

    devices, network devices, operating systems, and applications. Security-related
    parameters are

    those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters
    required to

    satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include,
    for example,

    registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings
    for functions, ports,

    protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration

    settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems.
    The established

    settings become part of the systems configuration baseline.

    Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists,
    lockdown

    and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation
    guides) provide

    recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration
    settings

    for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring
    those

    system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
    can be

    developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology
    product

    developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies,
    and other

    organizations in the public and private sectors. Implementation of a specific
    common secure

    configuration may be mandated at the organizational or mission/business process
    level or may be





    mandated at a higher level including, for example, by a regulatory agency. Common
    secure

    configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)
    which

    affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7.
    The Security

    Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol
    provide an

    effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.

          services].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the

    functions and services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to
    support essential

    organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes
    convenient to

    provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases
    risk over

    limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations
    limit

    component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations review
    functions and

    services provided by systems or components of systems, to determine which functions
    and

    services are candidates for elimination. Organizations consider disabling unused
    or unnecessary

    physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of
    devices, transfer of

    commonly referred to as whitelisting. To effect comprehensive whitelisting and increase the
    strength of protection for attacks that bypass application level whitelisting, software programs
    may be decomposed into and monitored at multiple levels of detail. Software program levels
    of detail include, for example, applications, application programming interfaces, application




    modules, scripts, system processes, system services, kernel actions, registries, drivers, and
    dynamic link libraries. The concept of whitelisting may also be applied to user actions, ports,
    IP addresses, and media access control (MAC) addresses. Organizations consider verifying
    the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums,
    digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software can occur either
    prior to execution or at system startup.

    management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Such plans define
    processes and

    procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development
    life cycle

    activities. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the
    development and

    acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how
    to move changes

    through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and
    baselines, how

    to maintain system component inventories, how to control development, test, and
    operational

    environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations
    can employ

    templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation
    of configuration

    management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management
    plan for the

    organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis.
    Configuration

    management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders
    responsible




    for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel that conduct
    security

    impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration
    items are the

    system components (i.e., hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be
    configuration-

    managed. As systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration

    items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need

    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall organizational

    program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
    Contingency

    planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission
    or business

    processes when systems are compromised or breached. The effectiveness of contingency
    planning

    is maximized by considering such planning throughout the system development life
    cycle.

    Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development
    can be an

    effective means of achieving system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the
    degree of restoration

    required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover
    to achieve the level

    of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable
    laws, Executive

    Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition
    to availability,

    contingency plans address other security-related events resulting in a reduction
    in mission or

    business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality
    or integrity of

    systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly
    and graceful

    degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information
    flows, and

    operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating
    contingency

    planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the
    necessary planning

    activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.

    organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted during
    contingency

    operations. The identification of critical information assets also facilitates
    the prioritization of

    organizational resources. Critical system assets include both technical and operational
    aspects.

    Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services, system
    components,

    information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include,
    for example,

    procedures (manually executed operations) and personnel (individuals operating
    technical

    safeguards and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection
    plans can

    aid in identifying critical assets.

    b.    When required by system changes; and
    c.    [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned

    roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate
    content and

    level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only
    need to know

    when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal
    duties are affected;

    system administrators may require additional training on how to set up systems
    at alternate

    processing and storage sites; and managers/senior leaders may receive more specific
    training on

    how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and
    how to establish

    communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on
    contingency-

    related activities. Training for contingency roles/responsibilities reflects the
    specific continuity

    requirements in the contingency plan.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the

    plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example,
    walk-through and

    tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive
    exercises.

    Organizations conduct testing based on the continuity requirements in contingency
    plans and

    include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and
    individuals arising

    due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in
    the breadth, depth,

    and timelines of corrective actions.
CP-4(1):

    Plans related to contingency plans for organizational systems include,

    for example, business continuity plans, disaster recovery plans, continuity of
    operations plans,

    crisis communications plans, critical infrastructure plans, cyber incident response
    plans, and

    occupant emergency plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations
    to create

    organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with
    specific plans.

    It does require, however, that if such organizational elements are responsible
    for related plans,

    organizations should coordinate with those elements.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from

    primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of
    information and data

    if the primary storage site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage
    site agreements

    include, for example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules,
    physical and

    environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery/retrieval
    of backup media.

    Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that
    organizations can

    maintain essential missions and business functions despite disruption, compromise,
    or failure in

    organizational systems.

    storage sites.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for

    primary and alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate telecommunications
    services reflect

    the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential missions
    and business

    functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations
    may specify

    different time-periods for primary/alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications
    services include,

    for example, additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits/lines
    or satellites in

    lieu of ground-based communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability,
    quality

    of service, and access when entering alternate telecommunications agreements.
CP-8(1):

    Threats that affect telecommunications services are typically defined

    in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters,
    structural

    failures, hostile cyber/physical attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations

    seek to reduce common susceptibilities by, for example, minimizing shared infrastructure

    among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic
    separation

    between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in
    situations

    where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services meeting
    the

    separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.
CP-8(4):

    objectives, and

    established organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements.
    Reconstitution

    includes the deactivation of any interim system capabilities that may have been

    This control supports system resiliency, contingency planning, and
    continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations can implement
    alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less effective than
    the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative or




    supplemental mechanisms, enhances mission and business continuity that might otherwise be
    adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the
    functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative
    capabilities, this control is typically applied only to critical security capabilities provided by
    systems, system components, or system services. For example, an organization may issue to senior

    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize

    Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users or processes acting on behalf of
    organizational users.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements

    in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential
    Directive

    12. Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations consider
    having the

    equivalent status of employees including, for example, contractors and guest researchers.
    This

    control applies to all accesses other than accesses that are explicitly identified
    in AC-14 and that

    occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.

    Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts
    or for detailed

    accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, physical
    authenticators, or

    biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case of multifactor authentication,
    some

    combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local
    access or network

    access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes
    acting on behalf

    of users, where such access is obtained through direct connections without the
    use of networks.

    Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting
    on behalf of

    users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal
    accesses).

    Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through
    external

    networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.
    The use of

    encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled

    endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal
    networks with

    respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing
    the network.

    PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
    Implement multifactor authentication for access to privileged accounts.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different

    factors to achieve authentication. Factors are defined as follows: something you
    know, for

    example, a password or personal identification number (PIN); something you have,
    for

    example, a physical authenticator or cryptographic identification device; or something
    you

    are, for example, a biometric. Multifactor solutions that feature physical authenticators

    include, for example, hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response

    authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification

    card or the DoD common access card. In addition to authenticating users at the
    system level

    (i.e., at logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the
    application

    level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless
    of the type of

    access (i.e., local, network, or remote) privileged accounts are always authenticated
    using

    multifactor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional
    security

    measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific
    types

    of access.

    Implement multifactor authentication for access to non-privileged accounts.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different
    factors to achieve authentication. Factors are defined as follows: something you know, for
    example, a personal identification number (PIN); something you have, for example, a physical
    authenticator or cryptographic private key stored in hardware or software; or something you
    are, for example, a biometric. Multifactor solutions that feature physical authenticators
    include, for example, hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response
    authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification
    card or the DoD common access card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level,
    organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their




    discretion, to provide increased information security. Organizations can also provide
    additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms,
    for specific types of access.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to
    achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-
    resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time
    synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.

    Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple
    system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by single sign-
    on capabilities with the risk introduced by allowing access to multiple systems via a single
    authentication event. Single sign-on can present opportunities to improve system security, for
    example by providing the ability to add multifactor authentication for applications that may
    not be able to natively support this function. This situation may occur in legacy applications
    or systems.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication

    are defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type and device. Organization-defined

    device types may include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems
    use shared

    known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet

    Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication
    solutions

    (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server
    with EAP-

    Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate
    devices on

    local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of
    authentication

    mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission/business requirements.

    Because of the challenges of implementing this control on large scale, organizations
    can restrict

    the application of the control to a limited number (and type) of devices based
    on organizational

    need.

    Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a

    device based on its configuration and known operating state. This might be determined
    via

    some cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification
    and

    authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are
    handled via a

    Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control

    (MAC), Internet Protocol addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management
    of individual

    identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual
    identifiers are the user

    names of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances,
    the account

    management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control
    also addresses

    individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing
    the reuse of

    identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group,

    Prohibiting the use of systems account identifiers that are the same as

    some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic
    mail address,

    makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for
    example, contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific
    characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational
    personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to

    c.    Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
    d.    Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution,
          for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

          protect authenticators; and
    i.    Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Examples of individual authenticators include passwords, cryptographic

    devices, one-time password devices, and key cards. The initial authenticator content
    is the actual

    content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast,
    the requirements about

    authenticator content include, for example, the minimum password length. Developers
    may ship

    system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for
    initial installation

    and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
    discoverable,

    and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual
    authenticators may be

    implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals
    and by

    controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in organizational systems
    including, for

    example, passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files containing encrypted
    or hashed

    passwords accessible with administrator privileges. Systems support authenticator
    management by

    organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics
    including,

    for example, minimum password length, validation time window for time synchronous
    one-time

    tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
    authentication.

    Actions that can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators include, for
    example, maintaining

    possession of authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others,
    and reporting lost,

    stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes
    issuing

    and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such
    as that required

    for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates
    and passwords.
IA-5(1):

    For password-based authentication:
    (a)   Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list
          [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when organizational passwords are
          suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;
    (b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the
        organization-defined list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords;
    (c)   Transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords;
    (d) Store passwords using an approved hash algorithm and salt, preferably using a keyed hash;
    (e)   Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;
    (f)   Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable
          characters; and
    (g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password authenticators.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control enhancement applies to passwords regardless of whether

    they are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords
    or passphrases

    are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal
    security

    benefit while decreasing usability. Account recovery can occur, for example, in
    situations

    when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for
    example,

    salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly-used, expected,
    or

    compromised passwords may include, for example, passwords obtained from previous
    breach

    corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. Examples
    include aaaaaaa,

    1234abcd, and qwertyuiop. The list can also include context specific words, for
    example, the

    name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.

    For public key-based authentication:
    (a)   Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and
    (b) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
    When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:
    (c)   Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust
          anchor including checking certificate status information; and
    (d) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for

    individuals and machines/devices. When PKI is leveraged, status information for
    certification

    paths includes, for example, certificate revocation lists or certificate status
    protocol responses.

    For PIV cards, the validation of certificates involves the construction and verification
    of a

    certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor which includes certificate
    policy

    processing. Implementing a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery
    and

    validation supports system availability in situations where organizations are
    unable to access

    installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system
    components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the

  text: Bind identities and authenticators dynamically.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and

    the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this
    binding is

    established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the
    system. For

    example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e.,
    authenticator) is

    accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the system.
    New

    authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator
    to be

    implemented outside a system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity
    and the

    authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems
    can

    authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning
    the

    identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate
    the dynamic

    provisioning of identities. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms
    with appropriate

    authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.

    mechanism,

    there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and stored
    biometric which

    serves as the basis of comparison. The matching performance is the rate at which
    a biometric

    algorithm correctly results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other users.
    Biometric

    performance requirements include, for example, the match rate as this reflects
    the accuracy of

    may

    employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious
    behavior.

    Such behavior may include, for example, accessing information that individuals
    do not typically

    access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater
    quantities of information

    than the individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information
    from suspicious

    network addresses. In situations when pre-established conditions or triggers occur,
    organizations

    can require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another
    potential use for

    adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the
    number and/or types

    of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not
    used to avoid

    multifactor mechanisms, but can augment implementations of these controls.

          response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and





    e.    Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated

    approach to incident response. Organizational missions, business functions, strategies,
    goals, and

    objectives for incident response help to determine the structure of incident response
    capabilities.

    As part of a comprehensive incident response capability, organizations consider
    the coordination

    and sharing of information with external organizations, including, for example,
    external service

    providers and organizations involved in the supply chain for organizational systems.
    For incidents

    involving personally identifiable information, include a process to determine
    whether notice to

    oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that
    notice accordingly.
IR-8(1):
  text: |
    Include the following additional processes in the Incident Response Plan for incidents involving
    personally identifiable information:
    (a)   A process to determine if notice to oversight organizations is appropriate and to provide that
          notice, if appropriate;
    (b) An assessment process to determine the extent of the harm, embarrassment, inconvenience,
        or unfairness to affected individuals; and
    (c)   A process to ensure prompt reporting by organizational users of any privacy incident to
          [Assignment: organization-defined roles].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Some organizations may be required by law or policy to provide notice
    to oversight organizations in the event of a privacy-related incident. Organization-defined
    roles to which privacy incidents may be reported include, for example, the Senior Agency
    Official for Privacy, Senior Agency Information Security Officer, Authorizing Official, and
    System Owner.

    Respond to information spills by:
    a.    Identifying the specific information involved in the system contamination;
    b.    Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the information spill using
          a method of communication not associated with the spill;
    c.    Isolating the contaminated system or system component;
    d.    Eradicating the information from the contaminated system or component;
    e.    Identifying other systems or system components that may have been subsequently
          contaminated; and
    f.    Performing the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or controlled

    unclassified information is inadvertently placed on systems that are not authorized
    to process such

    information. Such information spills occur when information that is initially
    thought to be of lower

    sensitivity is transmitted to a system and then subsequently determined to be
    of higher sensitivity.

    At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational
    response is generally

    based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information, the security
    capabilities of the

    system, the specific nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations
    of

    individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used
    to communicate

    information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated
    with the actual

    spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such
    contamination is

    isolated and eradicated.

    impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated
    systems are undergoing corrective actions.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Correction actions for systems contaminated due to information
    spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not have access
    to the contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct
    organizational business.
IR-9(4):

    Employ [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] for personnel exposed to
    information not within assigned access authorizations.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Security safeguards include, for example, ensuring that personnel who
    are exposed to spilled information are made aware of the laws, Executive Orders, directives,
    regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines regarding the information and the restrictions
    imposed based on exposure to such information.
IR-10:

    Establish an integrated team of forensic and malicious code analysts, tool developers, and
    real-time operations personnel to handle incidents.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information

    sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers,
    implementers, and

    operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat to implement defensive
    measures that will

    enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated
    teams promote the

    rapid detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the
    deployment of

    effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the
    integrated analysis

    team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate
    the new

    incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence
    development. This

    enables the team to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that
    are linked to the

    operations tempo or to specific missions and business functions, and to define
    responsive actions

    in a way that does not disrupt those missions and business functions. Information
    security analysis

    teams are distributed within organizations to make the capability more resilient.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

    effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the MA family.
    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize
    that restating

    controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance
    tools that are not within organizational system boundaries but are used specifically for diagnostic
    and repair actions on organizational systems. Organizations have flexibility in determining roles
    for approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. Periodic review of
    system maintenance tools facilitates withdrawal of the approval for outdated, unsupported,
    irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and
    firmware items. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting malicious code,
    intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools
    can include, for example, hardware/software diagnostic test equipment and hardware and software



    packet sniffers. This control does not cover hardware or software components that support system
    maintenance and are a part of the system, for example, the software implementing “ping,” “ls,”
    “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch.

    carried out by

    individuals physically present at the system or system component and not communicating
    across a

    network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal
    maintenance

    and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Strong
    authentication

    requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor
    authentication.

    Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored
    on a token protected

    parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before
    they occur or

    before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance
    is to

    avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance
    is designed to

    preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before
    they fail.

    Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure management policies
    to apply

    include, for example, original equipment manufacturer recommendations, statistical
    failure

    records, requirements of codes, legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction,
    expert

    opinion, maintenance that has already been conducted on similar equipment, or
    measured

    values and performance indications.

    Perform predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined system components] at
    [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to

    evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online)
    equipment

    condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance
    at a

    scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and
    before the

    equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive

    maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's
    condition.

    This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what
    point in the

    future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance
    inspections are

    performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal
    system

    operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and
    higher system

    reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item.
    To evaluate

    equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies
    such

    as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection,
    vibration

    analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.

    microfilm. Physically controlling system media includes, for example, conducting inventories,
    ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media
    library, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a
    locked drawer, desk, or cabinet; or a controlled media library. The type of media storage employed



    by organizations is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information
    residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas that provide sufficient physical and procedural

    microfilm and

    paper. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient
    physical or

    procedural safeguards to meet requirements established for protecting information
    and systems.

    Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security
    category or

    classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect
    media during

    transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic
    mechanisms

    can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms
    used.

    Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those
    activities such as

    releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport
    processes.

    For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include
    individuals from

    outside the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport
    includes, for

    example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking
    and/or obtaining

    explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation
    system to

    prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation

    requirements for activities associated with the transport of system media in accordance

  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control applies to all system media, both digital and non-digital,

    subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable.
    Examples include:

    digital media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations,
    network

    components, mobile devices; and non-digital media such as paper and microfilm.
    The sanitization

    process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be
    retrieved or

    reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic
    erase, and

    destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals
    when such media is

    reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization
    methods

    recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot
    be applied to

    media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of
    approved

    sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed
    to be in the

    public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations
    or

    individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media
    includes, for

    example, destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified
    document, or

    redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted
    sections or words

    in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NARA

    the use of certain types

    of media on systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives
    or external hard

    disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards to
    restrict the use of

    system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices,
    for example, by

    using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports,
    or disabling or

    removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may
    also limit the use

    of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices
    provided by

    the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices
    that are not

    personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage
    devices based on

    the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage
    devices, and

    implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write
    to such devices.

    Requiring identifiable owners for portable storage devices reduces the risk of
    using such devices

    by allowing organizations to assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities
    in the

    devices.

    Hardware components that may require marking include, for example,

    input devices marked to indicate the classification of the network to which they
    are connected or a

    multifunction function printer or copier residing in a classified area. Security
    marking refers to the

    application or use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers
    to the application

    or use of security attributes regarding internal data structures within systems.
    Security marking is

    generally not required for hardware components processing, storing, or transmitting
    information

    determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.
    However,

    organizations may require markings for hardware components processing, storing,
    or transmitting

    public information indicating that such information is publicly releasable. The
    marking of system

    hardware components reflects applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
    regulations,

    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

    effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the PL family.
    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policies or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize
    that restating

    controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set

    of security and privacy controls and control enhancements. The plans describe
    how the security

    and privacy controls and control enhancements meet those security and privacy
    requirements, but

    do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation
    of the

    controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient
    information

    (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection
    statements either

    explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously
    compliant

    with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational
    operations and

    assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented
    as intended.

    Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the control baselines in Appendix
    D to develop

    overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies,
    missions,

    business applications, or environments of operation.

    Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection
    of various

    documents including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy
    plans make

    extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents
    including, for

    example, design and implementation specifications where more detailed information
    can be

    obtained. This reduces the documentation associated with security and privacy
    programs and

    maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management
    and

    operational areas including, for example, enterprise architecture, system development
    life cycle,

    systems engineering, and acquisition. Thus, security and privacy plans do not
    contain detailed

    contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly
    or by

    reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those
    plans.

    consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities,
    differentiating, for

    example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to
    the general user

    population. Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational
    users including,

    for example, individuals who simply receive data or information from federal systems,
    is often not

    feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their
    interactions with the

    systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users can
    also be established

    in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4b, the documented acknowledgment portion
    of the control,

    may be satisfied by the security and privacy awareness training and the role-based
    security and

    privacy training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes
    rules of behavior.

    Documented acknowledgements for rules of behavior may include, for example, electronic
    or

    development of systems. The security and privacy architectures at the system level
    are consistent




    with and complement the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described
    in PM-7

    that are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The
    security and privacy

    architectures include an architectural description, the placement and allocation
    of security and

    privacy functionality (including security and privacy controls), security- and
    privacy-related

    information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces,
    and the

    protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security
    and privacy

    architectures can include other information, for example, user roles and the access
    privileges

    assigned to each role, unique security and privacy requirements, types of information
    processed,

    stored, and transmitted by the system, restoration priorities of information and
    system services,

    and any other specific protection needs.

    In today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations
    to

    control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information
    services

    and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy
    architectures is

    important to developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy.
    Establishing,

    developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline
    configuration

    for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective
    security and

    privacy architectures. The development of the security and privacy architectures
    is coordinated

    with the Senior Agency Information Security Officer and the Senior Agency Official
    for Privacy

    to ensure that security and privacy controls needed to support security and privacy
    requirements

    are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations
    to ensure

    that they develop security and privacy architectures for the system, and that
    the architectures are

    integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the
    organization-wide

    security and privacy architectures. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at
    external information

    technology product and system developers and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary
    to PL-

    8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or system
    components to

    external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s
    enterprise

    architecture and security and privacy architectures.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,

    technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries must overcome
    multiple

    safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple
    mechanisms

    makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources
    by increasing the

    work factor of the adversary. It also increases the likelihood of detection. The
    coordination of

    allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard
    does not

    create adverse unintended consequences by interfering with other safeguards. Examples
    of

    such unintended consequences include system lockout and cascading alarms. Placement
    of

    security safeguards is an important activity requiring thoughtful analysis. The
    criticality or

    value of the organizational asset is a key consideration in providing additional
    layering.

  supplemental-guidance: |2
     Different information technology products have different strengths and
     weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.
     For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at



    different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on
    their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations
    there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code.

    Centrally manage [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy controls and
    related processes].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Central management refers to the organization-wide management and

    implementation of selected security and privacy controls and related processes.
    This includes

    planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined,
    centrally

    managed controls and processes. As the central management of security and privacy
    controls is

    generally associated with the concept of common controls, such management promotes
    and

    facilitates standardization of control implementations and management and judicious
    use of

    organizational resources. Centrally-managed controls and processes may also meet
    independence

    requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations
    to operate and as

    part of organizational continuous monitoring. As part of the security and privacy
    control selection

    processes, organizations determine which controls may be suitable for central
    management based

    on organizational resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally
    manage every

    aspect of a security or privacy control. In such cases, the control can be treated
    as a hybrid control

    with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. Those
    controls and

    control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management
    include, but are

    not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4)

PL-10:
  text: Select a control baseline for the system.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    The selection of an appropriate control baseline is determined by the needs

    of organizational stakeholders. Stakeholder needs and concerns consider mission
    and business

    requirements and mandates imposed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
    policies,

    regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the three control baselines
    in Appendix D are

    based on the requirements from the Federal Information Security Modernization
    Act (FISMA) and

    the Privacy Act. These requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines
    implementing

    the legislation, require organizations to select one of the control baselines
    after the reviewing the

    information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted
    on organizational

    systems; analyzing the potential adverse impact or consequences of the loss or
    compromise of the

    system or information on the organization’s operations and assets, individuals,
    other organizations

    or the Nation; and considering the results from organizational and system assessments
    of risk.

    Nonfederal organizations that are part of other communities of interest including
    the U.S. critical

    infrastructure sectors, can develop similar control baselines (using the controls
    in Chapter Three)

    that represent the needs and concerns of those entities.
PL-11:
  text: Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a

    set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. These
    actions facilitate such

    specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security
    and privacy plans

    that reflect their specific missions and business functions, the environments
    where their systems

    operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any
    other conditions or

    situations that can impact their mission or business success. The tailoring actions
    are described in

    Appendix G. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating
    common

    controls; applying scoping considerations; selecting compensating controls; assigning
    values to

    control parameters; supplementing the control baseline with additional controls,
    as needed; and

    providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions
    in Appendix G

    can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations.
    Tailoring actions

    can be applied to the baselines in Appendix D in accordance with the security
    requirements from

    the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the privacy requirements
    from

    the Privacy Act. Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different
    control baselines

    can apply the tailoring actions in Appendix G to specialize or customize the controls
    that represent

    the specific needs and concerns of those entities.

    Information security program plans can be represented in single documents

    or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document
    the program

    management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security
    program

    plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common
    controls

    (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements
    either explicitly

    or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with
    the intent of

    the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented
    as intended.

    Security plans for individual systems and the organization-wide information security
    program

    plan, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the
    organization.

    Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information
    security

    program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for
    a system. The

    organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate
    security plans

    contain descriptions of common controls.

    Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document
    or in multiple

    documents. For multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are
    included as

    attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security
    program plan

    contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational

    official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,
    authorization,

    and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the Facilities
    Management

    Office may develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common

  supplemental-guidance: >
    The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the

    enterprise architecture ensures that security and privacy considerations are addressed
    early in the

    system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s
    mission

    and business processes. The process of security and privacy requirements integration
    also embeds

    into the enterprise architecture, the organization’s security and privacy architectures
    consistent

    with the organizational risk management and information security and privacy strategies.
    For PM-

    7, the security and privacy architectures are developed at a system-of-systems
    level, representing

    all organizational systems. For PL-8, the security and privacy architectures are
    developed at a

    level representing an individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent
    with the

    security and privacy architectures defined for the organization. Security and
    privacy requirements

    and control integration are most effectively accomplished through the rigorous
    application of the

    Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines.

    Protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to

    counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through
    the compromise of

    information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy).
    Information protection

    and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from mission
    and business

    needs defined by the stakeholders in organizations, the mission and business processes
    defined to

    meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information
    protection and

    personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required security
    and privacy

    controls for the organization and the systems supporting the mission and business
    processes.

    Inherent in defining the protection and personally identifiable information processing
    needs, is an

    understanding of adverse impact or consequences that could result if a compromise
    of information

    occurs. The categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations.
    Privacy

    risks to individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable
    information, but they

    can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of authorized processing
    of information

    at any stage of the data life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize
    the risks that are

    created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information.
    These risk

    assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization
    and systems

    Organizations handling classified information are required, under

    Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish
    insider threat

    programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in
    classified

    environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled
    Unclassified

    Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include
    controls to detect

    and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and
    analysis of both

    technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns.
    A senior

    official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual
    to implement

    and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration
    and analysis

    capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department or agency
    insider threat

    policies and implementation plans; conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
    employee

    activities on government-owned classified computers; provide insider threat awareness
    training to

    employees; receive access to information from all offices within the department
    or agency for

    insider threat analysis; and conduct self-assessments of department or agency
    insider threat

    posture.

    Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams
    that organizations

    may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams.
    Human resources

    records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence
    to show that some

    types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace
    including,

    for example, ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers
    and other

    colleagues. These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials
    in more focused,

    targeted monitoring efforts. However, the use of human resource records could
    raise significant

    concerns for privacy. The participation of a comprehensive legal team, including
    consultation with

    the senior agency officer for privacy (SAOP), ensures that all monitoring activities
    are performed

    threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have
    experienced,

    mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types
    of threats, and threat

    intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that can occur). Threat
    information

    sharing may be bilateral or multilateral. Examples of bilateral threat sharing
    include government-

    commercial cooperatives and government-government cooperatives. An example of
    multilateral

    b.    Establish the Data Management Board consisting of [Assignment: organization-defined
    roles]
          with the following responsibilities:
          1.   Develop and implement guidelines supporting data modeling, quality,
    integrity, and de-
               identification needs of personally identifiable information across
    the information life
               cycle;
          2.   Review and approve applications to release data outside of the organization,
    archiving the
               applications and the released data, and performing post-release monitoring
    to ensure that
               the assumptions made as part of the data release continue to be valid;
    c.    Include requirements for personnel interaction with the Data Management
    Board in security
          and privacy awareness and/or role-based training.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    The guidelines established by Data Management Board establish policies,
    procedures, and standards that enable data governance so that personally identifiable information
    is managed and maintained in accordance with any relevant statutes, regulations, and guidance.
    Members may include the Chief Information Officer, Senior Agency Information Security Officer,
    and Senior Agency Official for Privacy. With respect to data modeling, and the quality, integrity,
    and de-identification of personally identifiable information, data and information needs are met




    through organization-wide data governance policies that establish the roles, responsibilities, and
    processes by which personnel manage information as an asset across the information life cycle.
    The information life cycle includes creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance,
    dissemination, disclosure, and disposition. Members may include the Chief Information Officer,
    Senior Agency Official for Privacy, and Senior Agency Information Security Officer.

    Organizations executing Computer Matching Agreements or participating

    in such agreements with other organizations regarding applicants for and recipients
    of financial

    assistance or payments under federal benefit programs or certain computerized
    comparisons

    involving federal personnel or payroll records, establish a Data Integrity Board
    to oversee and

    coordinate the implementation of those matching agreements. As data is obtained
    and used across

    the information life cycle, it is important to confirm the accuracy and relevance
    of personally

    identifiable information. Organizations may integrate the function of the Data
    Integrity Board into

    the responsibilities of the Data Management Board under PM-24. In many organizations,
    the Data

    Integrity Board is led by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy.

          information for internal testing, training, and research;
    b.    Take measures to limit or minimize the amount of personally identifiable information used for
          internal testing, training, and research purposes; and
    c.    Authorize the use of personally identifiable information when such information is required for
          internal testing, training, and research.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations often use personally identifiable information for testing new

    applications or systems prior to deployment, for research purposes, and for training.
    The use of

    personally identifiable information in testing, research, and training increases
    risk of unauthorized

    disclosure or misuse of such information. Organizations consult with the Senior
    Agency Official

    for Privacy and legal counsel to ensure that the use of personally identifiable
    information in

    testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which
    it was collected.

    When possible, organizations use placeholder data to avoid exposure of personally
    identifiable

    information when conducting testing, training, and research.

         1.    Policies governing how individuals may request access to records maintained in a Privacy
               Act system of records; and
         2.    Access procedures in System of Records Notices; and
    b.   Ensure that the published policies and access procedures are consistent with Privacy Act
         requirements and Office of Management and Budget policies and guidance for the proper
         processing of Privacy Act requests.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Access affords individuals the ability to review personally identifiable

    information about them held within organizational systems of records. Access includes
    timely,

    simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational processes for allowing
    access to records

    may differ based on resources, legal requirements, or other factors. The Senior
    Agency Official for

    Privacy is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request
    processing, in

    consultation with the organization’s legal counsel. Access to certain types of
    records may not be

    appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting particular
    systems

    from the access provision of the Privacy Act.

    c.   Tracking mechanisms to ensure all complaints received are reviewed and appropriately
         addressed in a timely manner.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a

    valuable source of external input that ultimately improves operational models,
    uses of technology,

    data collection practices, and privacy and security controls. Mechanisms that
    can be used by the

    public may include, for example, e-mail, telephone hotline, or web-based forms.
    Information

    necessary for successfully filing complaints includes, for example, contact information
    for the

    Senior Agency Official for Privacy or other official designated to receive complaints.

    of
          information security and privacy requirements for all new or modified systems
    containing
          personally identifiable information;
    d.    Review the personally identifiable information inventory [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency];
    e.    Ensure to the extent practicable, that personally identifiable information
    is accurate, relevant,
          timely, and complete; and
    f.    Reduce personally identifiable information to the minimum necessary for
    the proper
          performance of authorized organizational functions.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations coordinate with federal records officers to ensure that

    reductions in organizational holdings of personally identifiable information are
    consistent with

    National Archives and Records Administration retention schedules. By performing
    periodic

    assessments, organizations ensure that only the data specified in the notice is
    collected, and that

    the data collected is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified in
    privacy notices. The

    set of personally identifiable information elements required to support an organizational
    mission

    or business process may be a subset of the personally identifiable information
    the organization is

    authorized to collect.
PM-29(1):
  text: |
    Employ automated mechanisms to determine if personally identifiable information is maintained in
    electronic form.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Automated mechanisms include, for example, commercial services
    providing notifications and alerts to organizations about where personally identifiable
    information is stored.
PM-30:

    Develop, disseminate, and update privacy reports to:
    a.    The Office of Management and Budget, Congress, and other oversight bodies to demonstrate
          accountability with statutory and regulatory privacy program mandates; and
    b.    [Assignment: organization-defined officials] and other personnel with responsibility for
          monitoring privacy program progress and compliance.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote
    accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting can also help
    organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy
    controls, compare performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in
    policy and implementation, and identify success models. Privacy reports include, for example,




    annual Senior Agency Official for Privacy reports to OMB; reports to Congress required by the
    Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act; and other public reports required by
    specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations. The Senior Agency Official for
    Privacy consults with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all
    applicable privacy reporting requirements.

    acquisition,
         maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and system services;
    b.   Implement the supply chain risk management plan consistently across the organization;
    and

    c.   Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-defined
         frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    An organization-wide supply chain risk management plan includes, for

    example, an unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the
    organization,

    acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for
    consistently evaluating

    and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating
    the supply

    chain risk management plan, and associated roles and responsibilities. The organization-wide

    supply chain risk management plan can be incorporated into the organization’s
    risk management

    strategy and be used to inform the system-level supply chain risk management plan.
    The use of a

    risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide application
    of the supply chain

    risk management plan.

    b.   Identify constraints affecting risk assessments, risk response, and risk monitoring;
    c.   Identify the organizational risk tolerance; and
    d.   Identify priorities and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Risk framing is most effectively conducted at the organization-wide level.
    The assumptions, constraints, organizational risk tolerance, and priorities and trade-offs identified
    for this control inform the organizational risk management strategy which in turn, informs the
    conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring.

         security policy.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

    effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the PS family.
    The risk

    management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures.
    Comprehensive

    policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and
    privacy program

    policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
    policies

    and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
    security and privacy

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize
    that restating

    controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

    a.    Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system; and
    b.    Rescreen individuals in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined conditions
          requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of rescreening].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable laws,
    Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and specific criteria
    established for the risk designations of assigned positions. Organizations may define different
    rescreening conditions and frequencies for personnel accessing systems based on types of
    information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    System-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication

    tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and
    building passes.

    Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints
    imposed by

    being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for system-related
    property.

    Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding
    terminated

    individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment.
    Exit

    interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in
    cases related to

    job abandonment, illnesses, and unavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews
    are important for

    individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions
    is essential for

    individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider
    disabling the system

    accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being
    notified.
PS-4(1):
  text: |
    (a)   Notify terminated individuals of applicable, legally binding post-employment requirements for
          the protection of organizational information; and
    (b) Require terminated individuals to sign an acknowledgment of post-employment requirements
        as part of the organizational termination process.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel
    regarding matters of post-employment requirements on terminated individuals.
PS-4(2):
  text: |
    Employ automated mechanisms to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
    upon termination of an individual.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    In organizations with many employees, not all personnel who need to
    know about termination actions receive the appropriate notifications—or, if such notifications
    are received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated mechanisms can be used to
    send automatic alerts or notifications to specific organizational personnel or roles when
    individuals are terminated. Such automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety
    of ways, including, for example, telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via
    websites.

    This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are

    permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted. Organizations
    define

    actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent
    or extended.

    Actions that may be required for personnel transfers or reassignments to other
    positions within

    organizations include, for example, returning old and issuing new keys, identification
    cards, and

    building passes; closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; changing
    system access

    authorizations (i.e., privileges); and providing for access to official records

    Conduct a second-level categorization of organizational systems to obtain additional granularity
    on system impact levels.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations apply the “high water mark” concept to each of their

    systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199. This process results
    in systems

    designated as low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. Organizations desiring
    additional

    granularity in the system impact designations for risk-based decision making,
    can further

    partition the systems into sub-categories of the initial, first-level system categorization.
    For

    example, a second-level categorization on a moderate-impact system can produce
    three new

    sub-categories: low-moderate systems, moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate

    systems. This secondary categorization and the resulting sub-categories of the
    system give

    organizations an opportunity to further prioritize their investments related to
    security control

    selection and the tailoring of control baselines in responding to identified risks.
    Second-level

    categorization can also be used to determine those systems that are exceptionally
    critical to

    organizational missions and business operations. These systems are sometimes described
    as

    high-value assets and thus, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation,

    and interconnections. Such systems can be identified by partitioning high-impact
    systems into

    low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.

    Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective

    risk assessments. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood,
    and impact to

    organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
    Nation based on the

    operation and use of systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from
    external parties

    including, for example, individuals accessing organizational systems; contractors
    operating

    systems on behalf of the organization; service providers; and outsourcing entities.

    Organizations can conduct risk assessments, either formal or informal, at all
    three tiers in the risk

    management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level,
    or system level)

    and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also
    be conducted at

    various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, control
    selection,

    control implementation, control assessment, system authorization, and control
    monitoring. In

    addition to the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system,
    risk assessments can

    also address any information related to the system including, for example, system
    design, the

    intended use of the system, testing results, and other supply chain-related information
    or artifacts.

    Assessments of risk can play an important role in security and privacy control
    selection processes,

    Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency

    and comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required
    vulnerability

    scanning for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities
    such as

    networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities
    to be scanned

    need to be readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and
    scanning

    methods developed. This process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities
    in the system are

    identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom
    software may

    require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary
    analysis, or a

    hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches
    in source code

    reviews and in a variety of tools including, for example, web-based application
    scanners, static

    analysis tools, and binary analyzers. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example,
    scanning for

    patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should
    not be accessible to

    users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating
    information flow

    control mechanisms. Scanning tools that facilitate interoperability include, for
    example, products

    that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP) validated. Thus, organizations
    consider

    using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures

    (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language
    (OVAL) to

    determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information
    include, for

    example, the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability

    Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional
    sources of

    potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using
    scanning tools that

    express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

    Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require

    significant protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example,
    supply chain risk

    management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification
    of critical

    system components and functions considers applicable regulations, directives,
    policies, standards,

    and guidelines, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces,
    and system

    and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional
    decomposition

    of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional
    decomposition

    includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system,
    decomposition

    into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
    hardware, software,

    and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions
    are shared

    by many components within and beyond the system boundary.

    The operational environment of a system or component may impact the criticality
    including, for

    example, the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices,
    system-of-

    systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access
    to critical

    system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities
    such

    components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of
    the impact of a

    component or function failure on the organizational missions supported by the
    system containing

    those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed when an architecture
    or design

    is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If done early in the system life cycle,
    organizations

    may consider modifying the system design to reduce the critical nature of these
    components and

    functions by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system
    design.

    A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the

    successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.
    To apply the

    required security and privacy controls within the system development life cycle
    requires a basic

    understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse
    impacts, and

    risk to critical missions and business functions. The security engineering principles
    in SA-8 help

    individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations
    include

    qualified personnel including, for example, chief information security officers,
    security architects,

    security engineers, system security officers, and chief privacy officers in system
    development life

    cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are
    incorporated into

    organizational systems. It is also important that developers include individuals
    on the development

    team that possess the requisite security and privacy expertise and skills to ensure
    that the needed

    security and privacy capabilities are effectively integrated into the system.
    Role-based security and

    privacy training programs can ensure that individuals having key security and
    privacy roles and

    responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned
    system development

    life cycle activities. The effective integration of security and privacy requirements
    into enterprise

    architecture also ensures that important security and privacy considerations are
    addressed early in

    the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational
    mission

    and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information
    security and

    privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with risk management
    strategy of

    the organization. Because the development life cycle of a system involves multiple
    organizations,

    including, for example, external suppliers, developers, integrators, and service
    providers, it is

    important to recognize that acquisition and supply chain risk management functions
    and controls

    play a significant role in the overall effective management of the system during
    that life cycle.

    one or

    more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems
    and

    the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The
    low-level

    design for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between
    modules

    providing security-relevant functionality. Design and implementation documentation
    may

    include information such as manufacturer, version, serial number, verification
    hash signature,

    software libraries used, date of purchase or download, and the vendor or download
    source.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in

    the system development life cycle, for example, during the initial requirements
    definition and

    design phases, allows organizations to influence the design of the system, system
    component,

    or system service. This early involvement in the system life cycle helps organizations
    to avoid

    or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily
    high

    risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols,
    or services

    or when requiring system service providers to do so. Early identification of functions,

  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation

    and operation of security and privacy controls associated with systems, system
    components, and

    system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine
    the quality

    and completeness of the content provided. System documentation may be used, for
    example, to

    support the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions.
    Personnel or

    roles requiring documentation may include, for example, system owners, system
    security officers,

    and system administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation may include, for example,
    directly

    contacting manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches. The inability
    to obtain

    needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the system or component
    or lack

    of support from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations
    may need to recreate

    selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the implementation
    or operation of

    the security and privacy controls. The level of protection provided for the system,
    component, or

    service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification
    of the system.

    Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level
    of protection.

    Secure operation of the system, includes, for example, initially starting the
    system and resuming

    secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering

    principles to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades.
    For legacy

    systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles
    to system

    upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of
    hardware, software,

    and firmware components within those systems. The application of systems security
    and privacy

    engineering concepts and principles help to develop trustworthy, secure systems
    and system

    components and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards,
    threats, and

    creating privacy-related problems for individuals. Examples of these concepts
    and principles

    include, developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies,
    architecture,




    and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating security
    and privacy

    requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and
    logical security

    boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software;
    tailoring security

    and privacy controls to meet organizational and operational needs; performing
    threat modeling to

    identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns,
    and compensating

    controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply security and privacy
    engineering

    concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure
    systems, system

    components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed
    risk

    management decisions. Security engineering principles can also be used to protect
    against certain

    supply chain risks including, for example, incorporating tamper-resistant hardware

  supplemental-guidance: >
    External system services are those services that are implemented external

    to authorization boundaries of organizational systems. This includes services
    that are used by, but

    not a part of, organizational systems. Organizations establish relationships with
    external service

    providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through business partnerships,
    contracts,

    interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements,
    joint ventures, and

    supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of
    external system

    services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations,
    a chain of trust

    requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each
    provider in the

    consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered.
    The extent

    and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations
    and the

    external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so
    the relationships

    can be monitored over time. External system services documentation includes government,
    service

    providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements.
    Service-level

    agreements define expectations of performance for implemented security and privacy
    controls;

    describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements
    for identified

    instances of noncompliance.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Information from external service providers regarding the specific

    Establish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service providers based on
    [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy requirements, properties, factors, or
    conditions defining acceptable trust relationships].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is

    at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external
    providers,

    individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organizations to
    gain increased

    levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate
    protection for

    the services rendered. They can also be useful when conducting incident response
    or when

    planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust relationships can be complicated
    due to the

    number of potential entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions,
    subordinate

    relationships and levels of trust, and types of interactions between the parties.
    In some cases,

    the degree of trust is based on the level of control organizations can exert on
    external service

    providers regarding the controls necessary for the protection of the service,
    information, or

    individual privacy and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the
    implemented

    controls. The level of control is established by the terms and conditions of the
    contracts or

    service-level agreements. Extensive control may include negotiating contracts
    or agreements

    that specify security and privacy requirements for providers. Limited control
    may include

    using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such
    as commercial

    telecommunications services.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is

    possible that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational
    interests.

    In such situations, simply having the required technical, management, or operational
    controls

    in place may not be sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those
    controls are

    not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations.
    The

    actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include, for example,
    requiring

    background checks for selected service provider personnel; examining ownership
    records;

    employing only trustworthy service providers, including providers with which organizations

    have had successful trust relationships; and conducting routine periodic, unscheduled
    visits to

    service provider facilities.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    The location of information processing, information and data storage,
    or system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the ability of




    those organizations to successfully execute their missions and business functions. This occurs
    when external providers control the location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria
    that external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be
    different from the criteria organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data
    or information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident
    response activities in case of information security or privacy incidents. Such incident response
    activities including, for example, forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be
    adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and
    storage occur and/or the locations from which system services emanate.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration
    management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security
    controls. Controls include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction,
    the master copies of material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware,
    software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or
    system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle
    to track authorized changes and to prevent unauthorized changes. The configuration items that are
    placed under configuration management include: the formal model; the functional, high-level, and
    low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code




    and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new
    versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and
    test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations
    and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration
    management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the system life cycle.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required security

    and privacy controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing
    the desired

    security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements.
    Security

    properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection
    of

    system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes
    including,

    for example, upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware,
    may adversely

    affect previously implemented security and privacy controls. This control provides
    additional

    types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate
    potential flaws.

    Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis,
    dynamic

    analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can
    use these analysis

    approaches in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. Security and privacy
    assessment plans

    provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the
    types of analyses,

    testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree
    of rigor to be

    applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth
    of testing and

    evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment
    process. The

    coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)
    of the artifacts

    included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria
    for security and

    privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the
    plans and





    processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment
    plans,

    evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification
    level

    of the system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code
    analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for

    security reviews and may include, for example, checking for weaknesses in the
    code and

    checking for incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities
    or

    that are out-of-date and not supported. Such analysis can be used to identify
    vulnerabilities

    and enforce secure coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when
    used early in

    the development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for
    potential

    weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with
    defects to

    enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static
    analysis

    can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types;
    evidence that

    defects were inspected by developers or security professionals; and evidence that
    defects were

    remediated. An excessively high density of ignored findings, commonly referred
    to as false

    positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis
    tool. In such

    cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from
    other sources.

    Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors,

    using all available information technology product or system documentation and
    working

    under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security and privacy
    features

    of information technology products and systems. Useful information for assessors
    conducting

    penetration testing can include, for example, product and system design specifications,
    source

    code, and administrator and operator manuals. Penetration testing can include
    white-box,

    gray-box, or black box testing with associated analyses performed by skilled professionals

    simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover
    the potential

    vulnerabilities in systems, system components and services resulting from implementation

    errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies.
    Penetration tests

    can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide

    Attack surfaces of systems and system components are exposed areas
    that make those systems more vulnerable to attacks. This includes any accessible areas where
    weaknesses or deficiencies in the hardware, software, and firmware components provide
    opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack surface reviews ensure that
    developers analyze the design and implementation changes to systems and mitigate attack

    Verifying that testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of
    required security and privacy controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques
    ranging from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of
    assurance corresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating

    Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software

    programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user
    privilege

    issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time
    tools

    to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A specialized
    type

    of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately

    introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies
    derive

    from the intended use of applications and the associated functional and design
    specifications

    for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and hence
    the

    assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis

    (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent
    of

    subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of
    the test suite)

    and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software
    code such

    as non-English language words or derogatory terms).

    It is also

    important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without

    security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to
    maintain




    provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production

    development,

    delivery, maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Tracking
    the unique

    Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can
    inform potential design and implementation issues for systems under development. Similar

    web-based and

    computer-based training; classroom-style training; and hands-on training. Organizations
    can also

    request training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer

    the architecture is

    integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction
    is important when

    organizations outsource the development of systems, system components, or system
    services to

    external entities, and when there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency
    with the enterprise

    architecture and security architecture of the organization. ISO/IEC 15408 provides
    additional

    are

    scoped to the specific behaviors or policies of interest, for example, nondiscretionary
    access

    control policies. Organizations choose the formal modeling language and approach

    consistent with that of the individuals accessing the system/component/service
    once deployed.

    Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearances,
    background checks,

    review and analysis

    of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially
    affecting

    the quality and reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    System management functionality includes, for example, functions that are
    necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions




    typically require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management
    functions is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation of system management
    functions from user functions, for example, by using different computers, instances of operating
    systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or
    some combination of these or other methods. This type of separation includes, for example, web
    administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system
    resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces
    on different domains and with additional access controls.

  text: Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    The system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by

    means of an isolation boundary implemented via partitions and domains. Such isolation
    controls

    access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that
    perform those

    security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, for example,
    through the

    provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel
    code, security

    function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect
    the code on disk

    and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict
    access to security

    functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege
    capabilities.

    While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation
    boundary to only

    contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity
    functions within

    the isolation boundary as an exception.

    Minimize the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation boundary containing
    security functions.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of

    nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions
    to minimize the

    nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity
    functions

    contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because
    errors or the

    maliciousness in such software, can directly impact the security functions of
    systems. The

    fundamental design objective is that the specific portions of systems providing
    information

    security are of minimal size and complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity
    functions

    in the security-relevant system components allows designers and implementers to
    focus only

    on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability
    (typically

    access enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation
    boundaries,

    the amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is significantly
    reduced,

    thus contributing to understandability.

    important

    with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies
    that one

    module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between different
    functions

    within a module. Best practices in software engineering rely on layering, minimization,
    and

    of

    concern can include, for example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that
    have breached

    or compromised the system and are subsequently using the system to launch attacks
    on other

    individuals or organizations. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals
    to connect

    and transmit arbitrary information on the transport medium (i.e., wired or wireless
    networks).

    Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system

    This control enhancement is implemented in remote devices including,
    for example, notebook computers, through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in
    those devices, and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable
    by users. This control enhancement is implemented within the system by the detection of split
    tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by
    prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might
    be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources such as printers or
    file servers. However, split tunneling can allow unauthorized external connections, making
    the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. The use
    of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with the appropriate security




    controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat
    such connections as non-remote connections with respect to the objectives of confidentiality
    and integrity. VPNs provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths from
    remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need for

    system components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for
    selected system components. Separating system components with boundary protection
    mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to
    more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced
    protection limits the potential harm from hostile attacks and errors. The degree of separation
    provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms
    include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into
    physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices separating subnetworks;





    virtualization techniques; and encrypting information flows among system components using
    distinct encryption keys.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for

    example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure
    and to enhance

    redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system
    servers; one

    configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server.
    Additionally,

    organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network
    subnetworks

    (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers
    with internal roles

    only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e.,
    from internal

    clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
    information

    requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks including
    the Internet).

    Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain
    roles, for

    example, by address ranges and explicit lists.

    requiring protection

    includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion
    detection and

    prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations
    may employ

    different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including
    the use of

    cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be
    achieved, for

    example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. When adequate

    to limited

    quantities of media generally associated with system components in operational
    environments

    including, for example, portable storage devices, notebook computers, and mobile
    devices.

    Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality

    integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate
    with the

    security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the
    flexibility to

    encrypt all information on storage devices or encrypt specific data structures

    Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational

    systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific
    technologies.

    Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those failures
    induced by supply

    chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood
    that the means

    adversaries use to compromise one system component will be equally effective against
    other

    system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully
    complete

    planned attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead

    While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose
    configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for
    adversaries to conduct successful attacks. Changing virtual operating systems or applications,
    as opposed to changing actual operating systems or applications, provides virtual changes that
    impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. Virtualization

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the

    targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available
    attack surface) to

    initiate and complete attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide
    organizations with

    the ability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful
    attacks without the

    cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment and misdirection
    techniques and

    methods including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may
    sufficiently

    confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery
    and/or exposing

    tradecraft. Concealment and misdirection techniques may also provide organizations
    additional

    time to successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of
    the time and effort

    required to support concealment and misdirection techniques, it is anticipated
    that such techniques

    would be used by organizations on a very limited basis.

    Such

    actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information
    resources of

    organizations supporting critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty
    may also cause

    adversaries to hesitate before initiating or continuing their attacks. Misdirection
    techniques

    involving randomness include, for example, performing certain routine actions
    at different

    times of day, employing different information technologies, using different suppliers,
    and

    rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Adversaries target critical missions and business functions and the

    systems supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, trying
    to minimize

    exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic
    nature

    of organizational systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible
    to

    attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing processing
    and storage

    locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced
    persistent

    threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing,
    and replication.

    This enables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing
    and/or storage)

    supporting critical missions and business functions. Changing the locations of
    processing

    activities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting
    activities by

    adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries making
    compromises or

    breaches to organizational systems much more difficult and time-consuming. It
    also increases

    the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft
    while attempting

    to locate critical organizational resources.

    employ incorrect and ineffective, attack techniques. One way of misleading adversaries is for
    organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific controls deployed in

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce

    opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity, or

    availability of information and systems. However, distribution of processing and/or
    storage

    components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of the
    distributed

    components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from
    the various

    distributed components and subsequently voting on the outcomes. Polling identifies
    potential

    faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and storage components.
    Polling

    techniques may also be applied to processing and storage components that are not
    physically

    delivery or electronic transmission of [Assignment: organization-defined information, system
    components, or devices] to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or systems].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Out-of-band channels include, for example, local nonnetwork accesses to

    systems; network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational
    traffic; or

    nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using
    the same channels

    (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels
    do not have the

    same vulnerability or exposure as in-band channels, and therefore, the confidentiality,
    integrity, or

    availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise or adversely
    affect the out-of-

    band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or
    transmission of

    many organizational items including, for example, identifiers and authenticators;
    cryptographic

    key management information; configuration management changes for hardware, firmware,

    Employ [Assignment: organization-defined operations security safeguards] to protect key
    organizational information throughout the system development life cycle.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential

    adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of
    organizations by

    identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that
    specifically relates

    to the planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC
    process involves

    five steps: identification of critical information; analysis of threats; analysis
    of vulnerabilities;

    assessment of risks; and the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC
    safeguards are

    applied to organizational systems and the environments in which those systems
    operate. OPSEC

    safeguards protect the confidentiality of key information including, for example,
    limiting the

    sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of system components
    and services,

    and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information critical
    to organizational

    mission and business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses,
    suppliers, supply

    chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications,
    testing and

    evaluation protocols, and security control implementation details.

  text: Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing process with the system.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing

    process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process
    has a distinct

    address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner
    controlled

    through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code
    of another

    process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be
    achieved, for

    example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is readily available

  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links
    that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized system users. Adversaries can exploit the
    signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways



    to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or spoof users
    of organizational systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless
    systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as
    commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement this

    This control often applies to types of systems or system components

    characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones, tablets, and E-readers.
    These systems

    often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment
    where the system

    is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include, for example,
    cameras,

    microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While
    the

    sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly,
    such devices can

    potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about
    individuals and

    policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature
    of organizations.

    The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
    if needed.

    Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
    at the personnel

    or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
    security and

    Organizations also address flaws discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring,
    incident

    response activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation
    into ongoing

    configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be tracked
    and verified.

    Organization-defined time-periods for updating security-relevant software and

    based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of
    the system or the

    criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the
    discovered flaw). Some

    types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations
    determine the

    type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under
    consideration and

    the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations,
    organizations may

    determine that testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,
    for example,

    when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations also consider

  supplemental-guidance: >
    System entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, remote-access

    servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
    computers,





    and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan
    horses, and

    spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within
    compressed or

    hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious
    code can be

    inserted into systems in a variety of ways including, for example, by electronic
    mail, the world-

    wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through
    the exploitation

    of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit
    or eliminate the

    effects of malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example,
    signature-

    and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include,
    for

    example, artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze,
    and describe the

    characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide safeguards against
    such code for

    which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be
    effective. This

    includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it
    replicates).

    Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition
    to the

    above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software
    integrity

    controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing execution
    of unauthorized

    code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and in
    custom-built

    software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other
    types of attacks that

    could affect organizational missions and business functions.

    In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods and
    technologies,

    organizations rely instead on other types of safeguards including, for example,
    secure coding

    practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes,
    and monitoring

    practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the
    functions intended.

    Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code,
    different actions

    may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to
    malicious code

    detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious
    downloads, or

    actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute
    files. Due to

  supplemental-guidance: >
    System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External

    monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at system boundaries.
    Internal monitoring

    includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations
    monitor systems,

    for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other
    system aspects such as

    access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring
    objectives guide and

    inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved
    through a variety

    of tools and techniques, including, for example, intrusion detection systems,
    intrusion prevention

    systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring
    software, and

    network monitoring software. The distribution and configuration of monitoring
    devices can impact

    throughput at key internal and external boundaries, and at other locations across
    a network due to

    the introduction of network throughput latency. Therefore, such devices are strategically
    located

    and deployed as part of an established organization-wide security architecture.
    Strategic locations

    for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and
    near key servers and

    server farms supporting critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically
    employed at the

    managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected
    is a

    function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems
    to support such

    objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper
    Text Transfer

    Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring is an integral
    part of

    organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs and output
    from system

    monitoring serves as input to those programs. Adjustments to levels of system
    monitoring are

    based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible
    sources of

    information. The legality of system monitoring activities is based on applicable
    laws, Executive

    Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

    address

    the fact that these types of software products may be difficult to review, repair,
    or extend,

    given that organizations, in most cases, do not have access to the original source
    code. In

    addition, there may be no owners who could make such repairs on behalf of organizations.

           organizational configuration management policy and procedures.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    System entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, remote-access
    servers, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, workstations, notebook computers,
    and mobile devices. Spam can be transported by different means including, for example, electronic
    mail, electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection mechanisms include, for
    example, signature definitions.

  text: 'Check the validity of [Assignment: organization-defined information inputs].'
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs including, for

    example, character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values, verifies
    that inputs match

    specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically
    follow well-defined

    protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate
    between

    software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or
    unstructured

    data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications
    use attacker-

    supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such
    messages, then

    the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause
    the data to be

    interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component
    that

    receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
    the data

    incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the
    content from being

    unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and
    correct inputs and

    prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
SI-10(1):

    (c)   Audit the use of the manual override capability.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    In certain situations, for example, during events that are defined in
    organizational contingency plans, a manual override capability for input validation may be




    needed. Such manual overrides are used only in limited circumstances and with the inputs
    defined by the organization.

    Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting
    systemic causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input.
SI-10(3):
  text: |
    Verify that the system behaves in a predictable and documented manner when invalid inputs are
    received.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    A common vulnerability in organizational systems is unpredictable
    behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures that there is
    predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying system responses that facilitate
    transitioning the system to known states without adverse, unintended side effects. The invalid
    inputs are those inputs related to the information inputs defined by the organization in the
    base control.
SI-10(4):
  text: |
    Account for timing interactions among system components in determining appropriate responses
    for invalid inputs.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    In addressing invalid system inputs received across protocol interfaces,

    timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider the
    impact of the

    error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example, 802.11
    standard

    wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols
    (TCP)

    when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes
    packet

    losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically
    dropped due to

    collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes
    the wrong action

    in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use what appears
    to be acceptable

    individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects through
    suitable

    construction of invalid input.

    Restrict the use of information inputs to [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources] and/or
    [Assignment: organization-defined formats].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to
    information inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable
    formats for such inputs can reduce the probability of malicious activity.
SI-11:

    b.    Reveal error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Organizations consider the structure and the content of error messages. The
    extent to which systems can handle error conditions is guided and informed by organizational
    policy and operational requirements. Exploitable information includes, for example, erroneous
    logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username; mission/business information



    that can be derived from, if not stated explicitly by, the information recorded; and personally
    identifiable information such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card
    numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information.

    Limiting the use of personally identifiable information throughout the
    information life cycle when such information is not needed for operational purposes helps
    reduce the level of privacy risk created by a system. The information life cycle includes
    information creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination,

    Organizations can minimize the risk to an individual’s privacy by
    using techniques such as de-identification or synthetic data. Limiting the use of personally
    identifiable information throughout the information life cycle when such information is not
    needed for research, testing, or training helps reduce the level of privacy risk created by a

          components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].
  supplemental-guidance: |
    While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential
    failures of system components that provide security capability. Failure rates reflect installation-




    specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define the criteria for substitution of
    system components based on the MTTF value with consideration for resulting potential harm from
    component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not
    compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability. This includes, for example,
    preservation of system state variables. Standby components remain available at all times except
    for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.
SI-13(1):

    For example, if the MTTF for a system component is one hundred
    days and the organization-defined percentage is ninety percent, the manual transfer would
    occur after ninety days.
SI-13(4):

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate system upon
    the failure of the primary system. Failover capability includes, for example, incorporating
    mirrored system operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data mirroring at regular
    intervals defined by recovery time-periods of organizations.

    Implement non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined system components and
    services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated [Selection (one or more): upon end of
    session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].
  supplemental-guidance: >
    This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by

    significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of
    opportunity and

    available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By implementing the
    concept of non-





    persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a known
    state computing

    resource for a specific time-period that does not give adversaries sufficient
    time on target to

    exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems and the environments in which
    those systems

    operate. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat regarding capability,
    intent, and

    targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of
    attacks will be

    successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required
    using

    protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence

    increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach
    organizational

    systems.

    Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, for example,
    by periodically

    re-imaging components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques.
    Non-persistent

    services can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual
    machines or as new

    instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).
    The benefit of

    periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require
    organizations to

    first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something
    that

    may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components
    and services

    occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks,
    but not with

    such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components
    and services

    may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum
    windows of

    vulnerabilities.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Certain types of attacks, including for example, SQL injections, produce
    output results that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be
    expected from software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting
    extraneous content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and then alerting
    monitoring tools that anomalous behavior has been discovered.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Preventing the sharing of personally identifiable information outside of
    explicitly determined elements helps mitigate privacy risks that may arise from using such
    information to detect anomalous system behavior. Organizations weigh the risks created by
    using personally identifiable information for information output filtering (as either signature
    or heuristic information) against the security risks they help mitigate and the established
    privacy posture in the privacy program plan.

    procedures include, for example, alerting operator personnel and providing specific instructions on
    subsequent steps to take. These steps include, for example, doing nothing, reestablishing system

    Use of controls to improve data quality may inadvertently create
    privacy risks. Automated controls may connect to external or otherwise unrelated systems,
    and the matching of records between these systems may create linkages with unintended
    consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in their privacy impact
    assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.

  supplemental-guidance: |
    Data tags that contain information about retention dates, usage or

    identifiable information can support the use of automation tools to enforce relevant data
    management policies.
SI-19(3):
  text: Collect personally identifiable information directly from the individual.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and

    relevance of personally identifiable information. These steps may include, for
    example,

    editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems
    using automated

    address verification look-up application programming interfaces. The types of
    measures taken

    to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the personally
    identifiable

    information, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to
    validate the

    accuracy of personally identifiable information used to make determinations about
    the rights,

    benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive
    than

    those used to validate less sensitive personally identifiable information. Additional
    steps may

    be necessary to validate personally identifiable information that is obtained
    from sources

    other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.
SI-20:
  text: Remove personally identifiable information from datasets.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to
    distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place
    of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information
    that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment
    information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals
    when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for
    the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that
    are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy





    protection, since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly
    used.
SI-20(1):
  text: De-identify the dataset upon collection by not collecting personally identifiable
    information.
  supplemental-guidance: |
    If a data source contains personally identifiable information but the
    information will not be used, the dataset can be de-identified upon creation by simply not
    collecting the data elements containing the personally identifiable information. For example,
    if an organization does not intend to use the social security number of an applicant, then
    application forms do not ask for a social security number.

  supplemental-guidance: >
    Datasets can be archived for many reasons. The envisioned purposes

    for the archived dataset are specified and if personally identifiable information
    elements are

    not required, the elements are not archived. For example, social security numbers
    may have

    been collected for record linkage, but the archived dataset may include the required
    elements

    from the linked records. In this case, it is not necessary to archive the social
    security numbers.

    IDENTIFIERS
    Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset.
  supplemental-guidance: >
    There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers from

    a dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can be removed.
    In masking, the

    direct identifier is transformed into a repeating character, for example, XXXXXX
    or 999999.

    Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed, so that the linked records remain linked.
    In the case of

    encryption or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use of a key,
    including, for

    example, the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication
    Code.

    Implementations may use the same key for all identifiers or a different key for
    each identifier.

    Using a different key for each identifier provides for a higher degree of security
    and privacy.

    Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including for example,
    transforming

    “George Washington” to “PATIENT,” or replaced with a realistic surrogate value,
    including

    for example, transforming “George Washington” to “Abraham Polk.”

    a school publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students, and in January the





    school reports that it has 10-19 such students, but in March it reports that it has 20-29 such

  supplemental-guidance: >
    The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the

    result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and after
    the addition or

    removal of a single data record (which is assumed to be the data from a single
    individual). In

    its most basic form, differential privacy applies only to online query systems.
    However, it can

    also be used to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic
    data. Differential

    privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations
    to quantify

    the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness,
    and utility of

    the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include, for example, adding
    small

    random values to the results of mathematical operations in dataset analysis.

    data that are re-

    identifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may
    contain bugs or

    may implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data,

    A motivated intruder test is a test in which a person or group takes a

    data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one or more individuals
    in the

    de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount of inside knowledge, financial
    resources,

    computational resources, data, and skills that intruders have at their disposal
    to conduct the

    tests. A motivated intruder test can identify if de-identification is insufficient.
    It can also be a

    useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient;
    however, the test

    alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient.
